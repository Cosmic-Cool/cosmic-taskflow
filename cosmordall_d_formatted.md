> **FOREWORD**
>
> In the broadest sense, science concerns how experience is organized
> and integrated, for by the endeavor we seek to integrate our
> experience in more meaningful ways. Our efforts therefore imply that
> there is an order underlying the whole of phenomenal experience that
> can be understood. It is this that is meant by cosmic order. It has
> two faces that are properly complementary. The face directed outward
> to our mutual social undertakings is the face of science that will
> concern us here. The other face seeks meaning in personal experience.
> It is a spiritual pursuit that is essentially private but nevertheless
> relevant. This strange Janus-faced order has been a subject of
> interest to humans since we first looked at the stars and wondered.
>
> In the pages that follow, it will be shown that there is a
> nonlinguistic way to delineate a self-consistent System of
> organization that is all pervasive. It allows of unlimited elaboration
> within itself through a progression of discrete sub-systems,
> associated with the reconciliation of multiplicity and unity. It is a
> living dynamic system. In this respect it offers new insights into
> both the physical and biological sciences.
>
> Book I concentrates on the development of the lower three systems with
> the main emphasis on the physical sciences, introducing new
> mathematical identities and a related quantum-relativity with
> cosmological implications. The lower systems are most fundamental.
> They transcend and subsume the higher systems. They generate the
> primary patterns elaborated upon in the higher systems.
>
> Book II is devoted to System 4, with the main emphasis on its precise
> correspondence to nervous system function and the integration of
> meaning, synapse by synapse. The same pattern is shown to prevail
> throughout biological evolution. It is thus evident within the cell as
> it relates to organ and host in complex multi-cellular creatures. This
> fundamental integrative power offers new horizons to the whole of
> science.
>
> The presentation has a strong academic flavor, for it must be
> rigorously self consistent, and also consistent with the vast fund of
> factual knowledge that we have accumulated over the centuries. The
> informed lay reader may nevertheless follow the general development if
> they persist. It is a captivating adventure.

> An historical review of the empirical evidence indicates a fundamental

> is indicated that complements traditional methods of science.

II. **Introducing The System.** Page 23

> The System of delineating the cosmic order embraces all possible

III. **Introducing System 3.** Page 39

> System 3 delineates the synchronous projection of matter as a

> Void. The Void is a master repository that spans space and time. It
> integrates the whole of history. The symmetries of the hydrogen atom
> emerge accordingly in a way that defines the nature of space and time.

IV. **Gravity, Quantum Relativity & System 3.** Page 61

V.  **Quantum Atoms, Space & Time.** Page 85

> A review of atomic theory shows that early contributions to quantum

VI. **Cosmology & System 3.** Page 111

> The angular velocity of galactic stellar populations is relatively
> constant at various galactic radii except near an accretion disc at
> black hole centers. This results in a relatively constant galactic
> contraction ratio across the galaxy's external space-time profile. As
> fresh stocks of primary hydrogen are ejected radially outward from the

> that continue to migrate outward until their accumulated internal
> space-time contraction associated with fusion processes exceeds the
> contraction profile of the galaxy. At that point old dense stars
> become drawn back toward the center of the galaxy by the same quantum
> forces. In this way galaxies creatively regenerate their stellar
> populations eternally with a variety of observational effects. These
> include the red shift, the background radiation, quasars and related

######## CHAPTER I

> **A NEW PROSPECTUS, AN ANCIENT THEME**
>
> **Abstract:**
>
> **A review of historical theories about the nature of phenomenal
> experience reveals a pattern that shifted, in the west, toward an
> externalized causal view in linear time, with Aristotle's rejection of
> Plato's Theory of Forms. Earlier perspectives of the cosmic order
> focused upon the interdependence between universal and particular
> aspects of experience. When modern science began it was thus founded
> upon Aristotle's view of local causal influences. In this century,
> quantum and relativity theories have developed as often contradictory
> solutions to universals that keep intruding into the landscape. A new
> methodology that complements traditional approaches to science offers
> a coherent assimilation of the empirical evidence. The result is a
> synchronous *quantum relativity* integrating universal and particular
> elements of phenomena, at all levels of experience from the atom to
> the cosmos---a new view of the *cosmic order*. In the process a new
> class of *quantum forces* becomes apparent that integrates history by
> maintaining a preponderance of synchronicity in the primary projection
> of matter on a cosmic scale. This timeless universe addresses many
> questions associated with the quantum of action, light transmission,
> relative motion, missing mass, gravitation, electromagnetism, red
> shift, background radiation, quasars, and other phenomena. This
> universal methodology for the sciences is the picture on the cover of
> box that can guide the assimilation of the jigsaw pieces of empirical
> evidence into a coherent whole.**
>
> In the last few generations we have been encouraged to take smug
> satisfaction in the frantic pace of our scientific achievements. There
> is little need to elaborate. From the first motor car to the moon in a
> living memory! From the first feeble wireless to global satellite
> communication! We are probing the heavens, the atom, and the mind to
> the very frontiers of creation itself, at least so we tell ourselves.

> If we step back for a broader view of the canvas, however, a strangely
> inconsistent perspective emerges. Different patches of the landscape
> clash grotesquely. Some gaping holes have been left untouched, some
> remain in a state of confusion. Other scenes have been painted over so
> many times that the history of development has been lost under layer
> upon layer going back to antiquity. From our involvement close up we
> are prone to believe that the incongruities can be glossed over in the
> modern idiom, a grand unified view emerging in triumph, once and for
> all. Praise be to man! Is science becoming a religion? Or can the one

> Our myopic fixation obscures a fundamental reality. Our collective
> knowledge, however immense, is utterly dependent upon a few fragile
> principles of understanding, very tenuously rooted in our cultural
> ancestry, and in good measure lost in the misty dawn of recorded

> such underlying precepts is extremely limited. They change only with
> the tide of history, for they determine the plot as the human story
> evolves.
>
> These precepts concern the structure of phenomenal experience
> itself---the *cosmic order*. Our power to cope with experience derives
> from them, to the extent that they are consistent with the cosmic

> through time, for the steps that we take can span millennia.

> We are accustomed to think that the roots of western philosophy,

> While this may be a milestone in the story, the Greeks in turn found
> inspiration in cultural developments that had bloomed over two

> Egypt were linked by the Persian Empire to the shores of Greece in the
> mid sixth century BC, bringing these influences more sharply into
> focus.2 Early Greek thought was very much in accord with much earlier

> There are anomalies in the pattern of course, even where connections
> between Greece and India seem obvious. For instance early non-Vedic
> Indian materialism, in rejecting that nature reveals any
> transcendental power working behind it, declared: ―*Fire is hot;
> water, cold; and the air is temperate to the touch. Who could have
> brought such distinctions into being, if they were not of the very
> essence of those objects*.‖ Although Aristotle was not a materialist
> in the same sense, this view is strikingly similar to his position
> that the essence is what a thing is by its very nature, what gives it
> its identity, thus identifying the essence with substance. Yet
> Aristotle didn't extend his position to embrace atomic theory as
> proposed by Leucippus and Democritus in the late fifth century BC, a
> development that was similar to the appearance of atomism in both the
> Vedic and non-Vedic systems of India. The Nyaya-Vaisesika, for
> example, postulates indivisible and super-sensuous particles as the
> ultimate cause of all the material products found in the universe.4

> In 325 BC, the Persian Empire fell to Alexander the Great, an event
> that signaled a turn in the tide of history. Alexander's teacher,
> Aristotle, was instrumental in reformulating Greek thought and the
> shape of things to come. He set aside the vagaries of mystical insight
> into the creative order in favor of deduced conclusions based on
> assumptions about the nature of phenomena. He granted objective
> analysis ascendancy over intuitive insight. Through his treatment of
> syllogistic argument, experience thus became externalized, although
> this momentous step was to take more than two thousand years to
> mature. By identifying essence with the concrete individual object,
> Aristotle atomized the universe more surely and permanently than
> Democritus ever could have done, although it is unlikely that he
> intended the course that ensued. His nexus of four causes, operative
> through an assumed linear flow of time, completed a general framework
> for linking up an atomized universe in its all pervasive vessel of
> space. Together with subsequent and consistent contributions from
> Euclid of Alexandria, Archimedes of Syracuse, and Apollonius of Perga,
> the door was closed on the sacred geometries that had preceded them
> for two thousand years. The plot for events far in the future was
> outlined in their place. This is not to reduce Aristotle's
> contribution to this framework alone, for this was not his conscious
> intention and the breadth of his work is well known.

> above, suggest a scenario very different from the one that we
> presently imagine to reflect reality. The main points can be
> summarized as follows:

1)  Planck's constant clearly points to two alternate modes for what we
    perceive as the material content of the universe. The one mode is
    fixed as particulate matter and is specifically determined in
    spatially complete form. The alternate mode, although quantized as
    bundles of energy that correspond to particulate matter, is
    non-specific and cannot be spatially identified. This requires that
    the material content of the universe is in fact involved in a very
    rapid and universally synchronous oscillation between the two modes.
    One mode is spatially complete, the other mode spatially
    indeterminate and timeless, such that events are prescribed by
    sequential frames in a holographic movie of cosmic proportions. The
    spatially complete frames will be called *space frames*. The
    timeless spatially indeterminate frames will be called *quantum
    frames*.

2)  What we know as the wave character of matter is associated with the
    synchronous oscillation back and forth between the two modes. This
    means that the entire universe is vanishing and recurring very
    rapidly with and before our eyes, the continuity of events being
    provided by quantum jumps in position from one space frame to the
    next, through the agency of

> 13
>
> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I
>
> the timeless quantum frames. This is analogous to an ordinary movie
> where the blank screen facilitates the projection of successive frames
> to lend the illusion of continuous action. The blank screen in this
> case is the spatially and temporally indeterminate quantum frames that
> are integrated as a boundless orthogonal field that is called the
> Void. The Void allows an ever changing assimilation and configuration
> of particulate matter in a series of space frames. There is thus a
> dynamic identity between spatial form and quantized energy as
> non-specific emptiness, the Void. The Void acts as a *master
> sensorium* or memory bank. It is a repository of experience behind
> space frames. Because experience is in reflux and renewal, the
> sensorium also spans and integrates history. It regulates
> non-synchronous elements that arise due to relative motions.

3)  The quantization of the electromagnetic spectrum, as it projects
    through space, is a universal measure of this fundamental
    oscillating action, hence Planck's relation E=hf. The quantization
    of energy, E, is a function of the frequency, f, because the
    universal action, h, is synchronous for all frequencies. The
    electromagnetic spectrum is being interrupted across its entire
    breadth by the successive disappearance and recurrence of space
    frames, thus requiring light to project as a series of discrete
    pulses.

4)  The speed of light, as measured in vacuum through space, is
    universally constant because the recurrence of space frames is
    universally synchronous irrespective of relative motions. Relative
    motions can be known only between relative positions in successive
    space frames. Light derives from within atoms and can only move a
    specific distance with respect to each atom in each successive space
    frame. It must close the space in the integrated fabric of
    space-time by linking up all atoms of particulate matter. Light
    defines space relative to each atom. Space and time are quantized.

5)  Time, as we are able to measure it as a linear phenomenon, is
    associated with the recurrence of space frames. We measure time by
    regular cyclic motions, such as the rotation of the earth, and these
    motions reflect a series of quantum jumps in position through
    successive space frames. Each successive frame thus specifies a
    universal primary interval of time. It is possible to measure the
    length of this interval in terms of classical units of time because
    each space frame recurs for a specific duration relative to the
    propagation of light. It will be shown that this primary interval is
    1.519 x 10-16 seconds. This is roughly the time required for light
    to circumscribe the largest atom, since the atom must be spatially
    coherent within each space frame.

6)  Although a common simultaneity for separate bodies, in relative
    motion through space, may not be established through direct
    measurements with clocks, as relativity theory maintains,12 we may
    nevertheless attach a

7)  Gravity is universally operative independent of transmission through
    space and time, since it is associated with the universally
    synchronous projection of the movie. It is an expression of an
    underlying unity implicit in all particulate matter. The attractive
    force of gravity resides in the universal aspect common to diverse
    forms of matter separated in space, and it is effected through the
    quantum mode. The tendency to come together is an expression of the
    oneness of physical being, a oneness that is manifest in the Void.
    In this respect the unity of the quantum frame is the conjugate
    inverse of the space frame where particulate matter is separate and
    distinct. Since atomic matter oscillates between form and Void to
    define a primary interval of time what we see as separate matter is
    both One and Many at the same time.

8)  Relative motions tend to distort the perception of space and time
    because light is unable to fully bridge the quantum jumps in
    position between successive synchronous frames, and yet the movie
    must cohere as a whole. In Newtonian physics this tendency manifests
    as a force required to accelerate one body with respect to another.
    This shows up as a discrepancy of units in the familiar relation
    F=ma. The units of force and mass are essentially the same, leaving
    a discrepancy in distance per second per second. This is a
    discrepancy of change in position through successive frames that
    represents a relative skipping of space frames associated with
    Force. This distortion in the uniform perception of space and time
    is balanced by an external expenditure of energy as work. This is
    the inverse to the effect of gravity as an attractive force that
    functions from within. We shall see that gravity is one of a class
    of forces that function via the quantum mode.

9)  When relative velocities approach the speed of light a more severe
    kind of distortion becomes apparent because relative space frame
    sequences are perceived out of synchronization. There is a relative
    skipping of space frames balanced by a relative accumulation of
    quantum frames between different inertial systems, because light
    cannot otherwise bridge the jumps in position. The quantum
    sensorium, the Void, spans the relative history. This shows up as
    the familiar relativistic discrepancies indicated by

> sound reason to believe that these transformations ―\...do away with
> the absolute character of the concept of simultaneity,‖ as Einstein
> stated. They merely account for synchronous distortions between
> inertial systems.

10) Space frames are skipped in the inertial system of the *observer*
    with respect to the moving body. This is balanced by a relative
    accumulation of quantum frames with respect to the observed body in
    motion. There is no compelling reason to suggest that the position
    of a socalled stationary observer is necessarily an arbitrary matter
    and that we must accordingly seek out mathematically covariant laws
    with respect to continuous transformations of space-time
    coordinates. This principle of general relativity does not take
    cognizance of the fact that experience is not presented to us in
    this way. Uniform patterns of cyclic motions dominate the heavens in
    a highly organized hierarchical manner, cascading down from galaxies
    to suns to planets and moons. When we speak of inertial systems as
    resisting acceleration we must therefore see it within the context
    of the theater in which we are observing the movie. Acceleration is
    always relative to the preponderance of synchronous patterns of
    momentum that prevail, for it both conforms to and disturbs those
    established patterns as they exist hierarchically. A classic example
    is Foucault's pendulum. The arc of its swings is constant with
    respect to the fixed stars thousands of light years distant and thus
    rotates to counter the earth's rotation. The pendulum may be set in
    its swings by the gravitational pull of the earth, but the direction
    of its swings is synchronous with respect to the universe at large.

11) ![](images/cosmordall/media/image4.png){width="0.16666666666666666in"
    height="0.18833333333333332in"}Momentum is a quantization of uniform
    relative motion. This is inferred by de Broglie's wave equation,
    where the quantum of action, h, is equivalent to the product of the
    relativistic momentum of a particle, p, and its wave length . If the
    wave motion of matter is a result of the oscillation between quantum
    and space frames, then it follows that the wave length assigned to a
    particle should be associated with the quantum jumps in position
    from one space frame to the next, relative to its perceived place in
    the projection of the movie. A curious paradox arises at this point,
    because one would expect the wavelength to increase with the
    momentum, an increase in velocity representing an increase in
    wavelength from frame to frame. In fact the opposite must be true,
    because the product of the momentum and wavelength is equivalent to
    the universal constant, h. There is again a dimensional discrepancy
    of unit distance per second per second, which indicates that the
    paradox is associated with a synchronous distortion between the
    observer and the particle. If the uniform motion of the particle is
    offset by a relative skipping of observer space frames, the paradox
    is resolved, because the observer is also a collection of quantized
    momentum

12) Uniform velocities may be considered inertial because particulate
    masses are independently assimilated in the movie. The duration of
    each space frame is sufficient to allow light to circumscribe any
    typical atom, but not larger conglomerates of atoms as molecules in
    concentrations of matter. The latter are assimilated through atomic
    characteristics that allow them to mutually relate collectively
    through interfaces of interaction. Within each space frame, however,
    activity is restricted to electromagnetic phenomena. The uniform
    motion of an atom, or a unified collection of atoms, is a quantized
    event, occurring from one space frame to the next, along with the
    preponderance of other synchronous events. If there is no change in
    the degree of synchronous relationships from space frame to space
    frame, then no forces are introduced associated with further
    synchronous distortions. Velocity, or the relative lack of it, is
    therefore inertial so long as the relative shifts in position from
    space frame to space frame are uniform. It should be noted here that
    this requires another kind of time, or rather timelessness, that is
    distinct from linear time as defined above in point 5. There is a
    kind of duration that spans successive space frames to historically
    integrate the synchronization of events.13 This underlying timeless
    duration is associated with the Void, and has been referred to as
    the *quantum sensorium*. For instance, there is a relative
    accumulation of quantized energy associated with moving particles to
    balance the relative skipping of observer space frames. This is
    essentially a quantization of experience that does not actualize to
    the observer in

> spatially explicit form, although it remains associated with the
> moving particle as an increase in its relativistic mass, a physical
> contraction in the direction of motion, and a dilation of time.

13) A complete atom is a closed and spatially distinct entity. The
    photon energy level of the atom defines a closed spherical shell
    that constitutes the inner space of the atom as orthogonal and
    distinct from the external linear space between atoms. The
    relationship of photon to electron and proton therein is a closed
    electrically neutral relationship. If, however, an electron becomes
    excited beyond the ionization limit for an atom, then light is
    unable to bridge the distance within one space frame. The electron
    is said to be a free electron. Photon energy must span two or more
    space frames to close the relationship between electron and proton,
    and it is this spanning of space frames by photon energy that gives
    rise to

> the integrated fabric of space-time cannot exceed the speed of light.

14) In the organization of moons, planets, suns and galaxies, there is a
    wide variety of phenomena that necessarily follow according to the
    above scenario, some of them well known. For example we know that
    somehow, since the consolidation of our solar system, that about 98%
    of the angular momentum has come to reside in the planets, even
    though 99% of the total mass resides in the sun. The rotational
    motion of the solar system introduces synchronous distortions with
    respect to the galaxy that are associated with angular velocity,
    although the mass of the solar system must be generally synchronous
    with the galaxy at large. This angular tendency to synchronous
    distortions manifests as a relative skipping of space frames in the
    center of the sun with respect to its own periphery and the
    peripheral planets. Although this is largely accounted for by fusion
    processes in the center of the sun that effectively contract space
    they can not account for the whole discrepancy. There is a
    corresponding accumulation of quantized momentum associated with the
    planets that cannot actualize, and yet it must manifest itself in
    some way, if it is not to build to unlimited extremes. Since we
    observe a differential rotation between the center of the sun and
    its periphery, it is reasonable to conclude that the accumulated
    momentum becomes translated as a force of retardation operative at
    the center of the sun. (The poles rotate in 33 days, the equator in
    25 days.) This force is not transmitted externally through space,
    but rather internally via the quantum mode, as an internal winding
    down to preserve synchronicity. It is a force hitherto unidentified,
    and one of a small family of quantum forces operative on a cosmic
    scale.

15) The differential rotation of the sun accounts for the spiral
    wrapping of the sun's electromagnetic field around its girth, a
    portion of the field being swept out with the solar wind into the
    planetary disc and beyond. The great electromagnetic arches that pop
    out from the sun's surface, associated with sun spots and solar
    flares, appear as direct evidence of an electromagnetic bridging of
    discrepancies in angular synchronicity within the sun.14 The sun's
    magnetic pole reversals, that occur approximately every eleven
    years, are also essential to balance synchronous distortions that
    would otherwise accumulate to unmanageable proportions. The earth's
    pole reversals are much less frequent and have a different focus.

16) When we turn our attention to the galaxy, we find that the focus
    shifts to the regulation of its material content, as distinct from
    the angular distortions within solar systems. The material content
    of the entire galaxy must be preponderantly synchronous, both with
    itself and with other

17) Because galaxies must be preponderantly synchronous, quantum forces
    may come into play in a variety of ways. Angular synchronous
    distortions in solar systems, place them in immediate communication
    with the preponderance of synchronicity in the universe at large.
    Discrepancies between the external space frame skipping associated
    with the angular velocity of stellar populations around the galactic
    center seek a balance with fusion processes that contract internal
    space-time in stellar centers. The relative imbalance between
    internal and external spacetime is translated to the galaxy's
    stellar population as a regulatory force governing stellar
    migrations within the revolving disc. The entire stellar population
    of the galaxy becomes tensionally coupled within. It becomes one
    coherent whole. Stars must behave themselves within moderate limits
    and cannot go racing off without restraint at the beck and call of
    gravity, disturbing the synchronous integrity of the whole.
    Tendencies to excessive motions find a ready resistance. The
    apparent deficiencies in gravitational mass in current theories
    about galactic organization thus find new avenues of explanation
    that apply to many other phenomena as well.

18) There is a growing body of evidence to indicate that there is reflux
    of the material content of a galaxy though the galactic center. In
    this scenario, old heavy stars that have contracted internal
    space-time through fusion processes tend to migrate toward the
    center, where the integrated fabric of external space-time is
    contracted with respect to the periphery. They are drawn into an
    accretion disc and torn apart as they spiral in toward a black hole
    at the center. Then there are intermittent massive ejections of
    hydrogen from the center, with star formation apparent as it
    migrates out toward the peripheral disc.15 Starburst galaxies
    exhibit very high star formation rates that last for tens of
    millions of years. As more data becomes available it should
    consolidate into a picture of eternal stellar regeneration.16 In a
    synchronous universe, galaxies function as cells that creatively
    renew their stellar populations. The heavy elements, created

> the galactic core. There may be other phenomena associated with
> mass/energy reflux, via the quantum mode, back through the centers of
> stars, perhaps extending their productive lives.

19) When we look through our largest telescopes at the distant quasars,
    some of them emitting more energy than a thousand galaxies like our
    own, from a core only a light year or so in diameter, what are we
    seeing? When we see them oscillate with bursts of energy equivalent
    to the creation of millions of suns over a period days, even hours
    or seconds, what are we seeing?17 The light from a galaxy a few
    billion light years distant can be older than our solar system by
    the time it reaches us. We have circumscribed our galaxy a couple of
    dozen times, and the distant galaxies may be turning somewhat slower
    or faster, the rate of stellar reflux being adjusted accordingly.
    Yet we share the same synchronous present with that galaxy as it
    exists today. In the projection of the cosmic movie, light must
    bridge the intervening discrepancies in linear time due to relative
    rates of space frame skipping. The light that comes to us from
    distant galaxies spans the integrated history of change relative to
    us, since we are still synchronously projected from the Void as
    things are today. A number of effects are to be expected. For
    instance synchronous discrepancies alone can red shift the light
    that we see, and this is not necessarily associated with recessional
    velocity at all. It may only be associated with great distance. The
    associated history of relative space frame skipping shifts the
    frequency of the light toward the red end of the spectrum.
    Synchronous discrepancies accumulated over such a time can also
    greatly accelerate the apparent relative frequency of distant
    events, similar to de Broglie's moving particles but on a grand
    scale. Synchronous distortions may contract the history of stellar
    reflux in distant galaxies in the way that we perceive them,
    creating an illusion of highly exaggerated violent eruptions where
    none existed in reality. Such phenomena might be expected as
    observational homologues to real ejections of matter from galactic
    centers. Alternatively distant galaxies that have lower rates of
    relative space frame skipping may appear to be fragmented. There is
    no compelling reason to suggest that we are looking back in time
    toward the original creation of the entire universe. In view of the
    above, there are more compelling reasons to suggest that the
    universe never had an origin, that the creative process transcends
    events in linear time, that its history of change is eternally
    organized via the quantum sensorium.

20) The background microwave radiation is there, of course, and real.
    But is it really a remnant of the separation of matter and radiation
    during the early epochs of a supposed big bang? Given the current
    state of our understanding, there may easily be other explanations.
    This single wisp

21) A synchronous universe introduces limitations in the application of
    mathematical methods currently available, because the properties of
    space and time, as we measure them, are not continuous. There is
    thus a minimum limit to the increment of the differential in the
    calculus that becomes very significant in quantum events. The
    uncertainty principle is related. The relative position of a moving
    particle can only be known precisely within a single space frame,
    whereas the relative momentum can only be determined over a
    succession of space frames. These characteristics are implicit in
    the nature of phenomena whether our measurements interfere with them
    or not.

    This must allow for all possible variants of experience.

ii) There is an all pervasive dynamic interdependence between universal
    and particular aspects of experience that is fundamental to
    understanding the nature of phenomena of every kind. This is
    intimately associated with alternate modes in the cosmic projection
    of experience.

iii) The integration of experience displays hierarchical elements
     associated with degrees of universality subsumed in levels, as in
     the synchronous relationship of galaxies to suns to planets and
     moons. These hierarchies, as they are spatially perceived, are
     specific manifestations of a transcendent universal order.

> **A Rift in Universal Wholeness:**
>
> The concept of universal wholeness, as represented by System 1,

> distinction, or attribute of any kind. Meaning slips away from us. In
> order for there to be a subjective and objective aspect to things we
> must be able to distinguish separate active interfaces as boundary
> conditions of phenomena. We must be able to distinguish things as
> separate surfaces. This requires two active interfaces, one universal
> and unique and the other particular, representing many. Manyness can
> only find reconciliation with oneness in this way, as we shall see.

> This means that there is a fundamental *rift in universal wholeness*
> between the *universal* and the *particular* aspects of phenomena. It
> is this rift in wholeness that gives rise to the higher Systems that

> to mend the rift in wholeness. As humans we likewise seek a unified
> worldview to creatively relate to.
>
> **Grand Unified Theories and the Big Bang:**
>
> Scientific attempts to resurrect universal wholeness from an atomized

> **Quantum Mechanics and the Schism in Physics:**
>
> The development of quantum mechanics brought with it a dichotomous

> based upon any insight into the nature of reality. Consequently the

> System 2 is represented by two active interfaces. Each shares a common

> orientation* and there is a *subjective orientation*.

> **The Objective Orientation of System 2:**

> This basic pattern of two orientations, one subjective toward the

> thought. For example Parmenides (born c. 515 BC.) was one of the most
> influential of the Pre Socratic philosophers. In the fragments of his
> poem, *On Nature,* that have come to us Parmenides describes a journey
> to the Goddess of Justice, where he learns of the Way of Truth, and of
> the Way of Seeming. These two ways are similar to the two modes of
> System 2. The universal center manifests the wholeness of everything
> that is, having no generated origin and having no termination. The Way
> of Truth is to see this, as in the subjective mode where one
> particular center 2 perceptually transposes to face center 1. In the
> way of seeming, center 2 is oriented outward to the objective world
> where all is perceived consisting of Fire and Night (light and
> darkness), offering an account of the origin of stars, planets, and
> all things on earth. The phenomenal world is thus granted a degree of
> transient reality, wherein the opportunity is provided to know the Way
> of Truth as Unity.37 These two ways became interpreted by Plato as
>
> ―what always is and never becomes,‖ and ―what is continually becoming
> but never truly is.‖
>
> In his Theory of Forms Plato also recognized that universal archetypes
> determine the identity of particular examples of them. We recognize a
> tree by its relation to an transcendental archetype of all trees.
> Although his pupil Aristotle rejected the mystical transcendental
> character of Plato's archetypes, insisting that the quality of a thing
> was concretely implicit within the thing itself, nevertheless the
> universal archetype also remains implicit within the thing itself.

> **Organic Evolution as Reflux Back to Universal Wholeness:**

> hemispheres and an autonomic nervous system within a fixed quadruped
> format. This provides a capacity for cerebral reflection on emotional
> patterns of behaviour within an anatomical framework that is universal
> among the reptiles, birds and mammals in the biosphere.40 The patterns
> of sensitive response worked out by the invertebrates are integrated
> anew without re-exploring multiple limb structures, compound eyes and
> so on. Vertebrate evolution has a different focus altogether, in which

> progressive subsumption of all quadruped behaviour in the biosphere.
> Complex behaviour consciously integrates primary elements of behaviour

> **Summary:**
>
> System 2 transcends and subsumes the whole of history by prescribing
> the universal pattern of creative efflux and reflux. This is more than
> speculative metaphysics, for the pattern has correlates everywhere we
> look in the world around us. The hierarchies of centers recycling
> energy through creative activity are real phenomena.46 The integrating
> *archetypal idea* is known through its *particular forms.*47 This is
> true even of things that we make. We identify a particular motor car
> by its correspondence to the archetypal plan inherent in all motor
> cars. The archetypal plan is a real idea. It specifies how cars work
> and how they are built for a definite purpose. And the plan is clearly
> implicit in the design of each particular motor car.
>
> The two modes of System 2 result from the perceptual transposition of
> center 2, such that it alternately relates outward to the manifold
> creation then inward to the universal center, center 1. The
> integrating archetypal idea of a motor car is conceived through
> reflection in the subjective orientation. The transformation to
> specific particular motor cars in the objective orientation is
> realized in their manufacture.
>
> At the atomic level this recurrent action is associated with the
> quantum of action, h, such that the physical creation is projected as
> a very rapid series of still frames in a holographic movie, as
> suggested previously. This recurrent action functions in different
> ways on different levels through the hierarchy to maintain a
> subjective to objective balance in the integration of history.
> Although the pattern is implicit in System 2, it requires System 3 to
> elaborate upon it. System 3 delineates what will be called the

> We may expect to see light play a universal role in the integrating

> the parade of ever-shifting *forms*. We shall see that the *idea*
> itself becomes translated into organizing *routines* that in turn are

######## CHAPTER III

> **INTRODUCING SYSTEM 3**
>
> **Abstract:**
>
> **System 3 has two sets of three centers, one set being unique and
> universal, the other set being particular and manifold. Each set has
> two orientations making a total of four terms. They interact in pairs,
> alternating between a quantum frame and a space frame in the
> synchronous projection of phenomenal experience frame by frame, as in
> a cosmic movie. In the alternate quantum frame atoms transform into
> timeless and formless bundles of photon energy equivalents that are
> universally integrated into an orthogonal energy field that is called
> the Void. Linear time derives from the synchronous recurrence of space
> frames in which particulate sets delineate three dimensional atoms.
> Light originating from within atoms defines space with respect to each
> atom, linking up all atoms within each space frame to provide the
> integrated fabric of spacetime. Space and time are quantized
> accordingly. The quark-like universal set tunnels counterclockwise
> through the particular set. This gives rise to charge between centers
> 2 (electron) and 3 (proton), whereas clockwise tunneling corresponds
> to a degenerate involutionary variant and antimatter. A regenerative
> variant accounts for the neutron, being stable only in connection with
> the expressive variant that delineates the photon, electron and
> proton. The neutrino is a particle remnant of a photon associated with
> decay processes. A new quantum relativity emerges naturally with

> **Summary Observations:**
>

> as a universal pattern inherent in all activity. It provides a
> universal methodology that complements traditional approaches to the
> sciences. System 3 relates especially to the physical sciences. Since
> this introduces a radical departure from currently accepted methods, a
> few general observations may help to clarify some points of departure.

1)  System 3 is generated by two sets of three active interfaces or
    centers. One set is universal and one set is particular representing
    many of a kind. The two sets cohere together in alternating
    objective and subjective orientations.

2)  The oscillating orientations of System 3 constitute a succession of
    particulate *space-frames* that define linear time, alternating with
    *quantum frames* that are quantum constituents of the formless and
    timeless Void. The Void is an eternal memory bank, or *quantum
    sensorium,* spanning and integrating the whole of history. It is
    orthogonal to the integrated fabric of space-time.

3)  Each particular space-frame delineates the structure of a primary
    hydrogen atom that defines the spherical inner space of the atom
    distinct from the linear external space between atoms.

4)  There is no particulate motion in a space frame, only
    electromagnetic activity. All relative motion occurs as quantum
    jumps in position between space frames. Relative motions between
    atoms introduce relative space frame skipping which accounts for
    relativity effects. A quantum-relativity emerges naturally.

5)  Since all light is emitted from processes within atoms it defines
    external linear space orthogonal with respect to the inner spherical
    space of each

> 59
>
> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I
>
> atom. The speed of light is universally constant because light itself
> defines space with respect to each synchronous atom independent from
> relative motions.

6)  Synchronous distortions result from patterns of relative motions,
    accounting for electromagnetic and relativistic effects.71 Since
    space and time are quantized relative to each atom, relative space
    frame skipping due to complex patterns of relative motions in the
    heavens introduce a variety of effects. A new approach to cosmology
    results from the need for a preponderance of synchronicity in the
    universe as a whole

7)  System 3 is not consistent with the spacetime continuum assumed as
    fundamental to general relativity. Curvatures in the integrated
    fabric of space-time result from patterns of relative space-frame
    skipping due to angular motions. Relative space-frame skipping is
    generally consistent with the effects of special relativity, albeit
    from a different perspective that acknowledges universal influences,
    including quantum correlation.

8)  The System is not consistent with a Big Bang origin, since it is not
    consistent with a spacetime continuum and other assumptions
    essential to that theory. A new *quantum relativity* emerges with
    System 3, which has relevance also to subsumed biological and social
    systems of order.

9)  The System acknowledges more than one kind of identity. Conjugate
    identities are clearly distinguished from Aristotelian identities
    and triadic identities. There are many profound implications
    involved in reinterpreting mathematical identities.

10) System 3 prescribes a coherent perspective of a discontinuous but
    synchronous universe. This requires that there is a minimum limit to
    the increment of the differential in the calculus. Quantum
    correlation and the uncertainty principle are associated. New
    methods are required that take cognizance of these phenomena.

> **Introduction:**
>
> System 3 illustrates how separate particular hydrogen atoms are

> everywhere at once. In each integrated space frame all atoms are
> linked up by light that defines external space in relation to the
> inner space defined within each atom by discrete photon energy levels.
> All light issues from within excited atoms and it thus has a universal
> relationship to each independent atom irrespective of relative

>
> Space frames specified by each atom alternate with timeless quantum
> frames that are the photon energy equivalent of each atom. All the
> discrete quantized energy equivalents of all atoms in the universe are
> holistically integrated as *one* by the unique universal set in the
> quantum frames. This holistically integrated energy field is
> timelessly balanced and spatially indeterminate. In Systems 3 and
> higher it is called the *Void*.72 It is a quantum sensorium or master
> memory bank from which the world of form is synchronously recalled to

> space-time.
>
> The Void spans and timelessly integrates the whole of space and time.
> The Void integrates history. The timeless Void is orthogonal to space

> **Three Kinds of Identity:**
>
> System 3 clearly indicates three distinct kinds of identity. They have
> never been formally acknowledged as distinct even though they have
> been used in the most fundamental formulae of physics.
>
> The first kind of identity will be called *Aristotelian Identity*. It
> is the identity that we are most familiar with and that mathematics
> primarily depends upon. It equates separate things and numbers of
> things that are perceived as identical in space and time. Ten goats
> are the quantitative equivalent of ten fingers. One goat is identical
> with another, and so on. Rules of syllogism and algorithms develop
> accordingly.
>
> It may be noted that mathematics begins with the invention of numbers.
> The *Idea* of ordinary counting depends on the *Routine* of adding one
> more to give the *Form* of the succeeding number, consistent with the
> hierarchy of System 3. Although numbers quantitatively equate separate
> things each number also has a qualitative aspect that defines it as a
> unified whole.83 84 This is analogous to the space and quantum frames
> of System 3. Also the square of any number is equal to twice the sum
> of all the digits up to the quantum frame that qualitatively defines
> the last number in the sequence, similar to historic integration.85
> This is consistent with the second kind of identity.
>
> The second kind of identity we have called *Conjugate Identity*. It is
> the orthogonal identity between space and quantum frames represented
> by the historic coordinates. These identities creep in unnoticed to
> the formulation of our most fundamental laws of physics. This will be
> demonstrated in the next chapter with Louis de Broglie's derivation of
> his wave equation for matter.
>
> The third kind of identity can be called *Triadic Identities*. They
> relate to the way the countercurrent identities of the universal set
> intimately link up the three particular centers of each particular
> set. Quark theory and quantum chromodynamics makes use of triadic
> identities to some extent.
>
> **Concluding Observations:**

> pervasive ether which acted as a medium for the transmission of light.
> Since motion relative to the ether could not be detected, Einstein set

######## CHAPTER V

> **QUANTUM ATOMS, SPACE AND TIME**
>
> **Abstract:**
>
> **The Bohr model of the atom is fully reviewed, since it provided the
> foundation for developing the quantum mechanical approach to atomic
> structure. The most fundamental contributions to atomic and quantum
> theory are shown to be fully consistent with System 3. The primary
> interval of time is derived from the first orbit of the hydrogen atom,
> the number of intervals per orbit being the cube of the principal
> quantum number. The derivation of Louis de Broglie's wave equation is
> reviewed. Particle waves are clearly associated with relative jumps in
> position due to relative space frame skipping. The neutron is a
> regenerative mode of a secondary System 3. This applies to the fusion
> of the higher elements that contract internal space-time in stellar
> centers to compensate for contractions in the integrated fabric of
> external space-time due to relative space-frame skipping associated
> with the angular motions of stars. The perceptual transposition of the
> electron interface associated with the neutron accounts for the strong
> force and the weak force consistent with nuclear models.
> Inconsistencies in the Bohr semi-classical model are reconciled with
> the quantum mechanical model to provide transparent insight into the
> structural dynamics of the atom. A tertiary application of System 3 is
> linked to chemical synthesis and the evolution of planetary systems.
> The reflux of old stellar populations back through the galactic center
> regenerates the periodic primary projection of hydrogen radially
> outward to provide feedstock for new generations of stars. Galaxies
> are cells eternally regenerating their stellar populations. Alternate
> explanations for the red shift of distant galaxies and the background
> radiation are reviewed in Chapter VI on cosmology.**
>
> **Early Work on Atomic Theory:**
>
> Atomic hydrogen has been the focal point of investigation in seeking
> out the mysteries of atomic structure, for obvious reasons.93 It is

> and photon, intimately linked as a coherent whole. The structure of
> hydrogen has become an open secret because its telltale spectral
> fingerprints are everywhere in evidence throughout the heavens. When
> heated, a gas emits light at certain wavelengths that show up as lines
> in its spectrum, and hydrogen is the main constituent of stars. It
> constitutes the bulk of the mass of the entire universe and is the
> stepping stone to the higher elements. Investigators into the mystery
> of the atom have focused on this prime candidate and the clues it
> offers toward understanding secrets of the cosmic order. It has been
> an admirable piece of detective work.
>
> Following the pioneering work of Anders Jöns Ångström in the mid
> nineteenth century, Sir William Huggins identified ten spectral lines
> as being emissions of hydrogen in the spectra of stars. Johann Jacob
> Balmer followed up in 1885, showing that he could account for these
> lines by applying a simple empirical formula. Then the Swedish
> investigator Johannes Rydberg discovered in 1889 that the line spectra
> of many elements could be fitted by a single empirical formula.94 For

> **The Bohr Model of the Atom:**
>
> In 1912, Neils Bohr was working in the laboratory of Earnest
> Rutherford, who had shown that an atom consists of a small dense
> positively charged nucleus surrounded by the required number of
> negatively charged electrons to make up a neutral system. In
> undertaking to explain the spectra of hydrogen atoms using this model,
> Bohr hypothesized that within the atom some well established laws of
> physics do not apply, otherwise an electron orbiting a nucleus would
> radiate away all of its energy. This deserves some emphasis. *Bohr
> hypothesized that some well established laws of physics do not apply
> within the atom.*
>
> This remarkable statement makes a clear distinction between the
> internal space of the atom and the external space between atoms where
> the well established laws of physics do apply. He suggested that the
> electron could exist in a stationary orbital state without dissipating
> energy, and that light is emitted or absorbed only when it suddenly
> jumps from one stationary orbital state to another *without traversing
> the distance between orbits*. The frequency of the light is determined
> by the difference in energy between the two orbits, divided by
> Planck's constant

> The interesting point in reviewing this is that Neils Bohr, in

> might say.95 Bohr was trying to marry the Planck-Einstein relation
> *E=hf* to Rutherford's orbital atomic model and they didn't seem very
> compatible. He nevertheless advanced the following propositions:
>
> **The Centripetal Force Postulate of the Bohr Atom:**
>
> He postulated that the centripetal force that holds the electron in

> centripetal force that attracts the electron to the proton nucleus is
> the Coulomb force. It is directly proportional to the product of their
> electric charges (*e2* in the case of hydrogen) and inversely
> proportional to the square of their distance apart (*r2*). This
> relationship, being similar to the gravitational force, was shown to
> follow directly from System 3 and historic coordinates in the last
> chapter.

> There are important points from previous chapters to emphasize

> **COSMOLOGY & SYSTEM 3**
>
> **Abstract:**
>
> **System 3 requires that the universe is hierarchically discontinuous
> with cyclical motions introducing space frame skipping that must be
> accounted for on galactic, solar and planetary scales. On a galactic
> scale gravity holds stellar populations in orbit around their black
> hole centers but this centripetal acceleration introduces the skipping
> of external linear space frames. On a solar scale this external
> spacetime contraction is compensated for by fusion processes in
> stellar centers that contract the inner spherical space of atoms. A
> balance is required between these two phenomena in order to preserve a
> preponderance of synchronicity in the universe at large. This results
> in quantum forces that propel young hydrogen rich stars radially
> outward in the galactic disc while drawing old stars rich in heavy
> elements and neutrons back toward an accretion disc where they are
> eventually regenerated into primary hydrogen and periodically ejected
> from the black hole center as fresh feedstock for new generations of
> stars. Direct calculations show that galaxies are cells eternally
> regenerating their stellar populations in this way. Quantum forces,
> including gravity, are not transmitted externally through space-time.
> They operate frame sequence by frame sequence through the agency of
> the orthogonal Void that integrates history to maintain a
> preponderance of synchronicity in the universe as a whole. Space and
> time are quantized by the discontinuous projection of atomic matter.
> They are implicitly defined a posteriori to creation by processes at
> the atomic level. There is no a priori spacetime continuum that
> predetermines a beginning or end to the universe. There are alternate
> explanations for the red shift and background radiation that offer
> explanations for other mysterious phenomena.**
>
> **A General Review:**
>
> There are hierarchies implicit in the way System 3 works that are
> evident in phenomena on a cosmic galactic scale, a solar scale and a
> planetary scale. On a galactic scale different galaxies revolve with
> respect to one another. This necessarily introduces space frame
> skipping at their centers with respect to their peripheries. The

> stellar populations curve accordingly since gravitational acceleration
> toward the center involves the skipping of external linear space
> frames relative to the spherical inner space associated with the
> gravitational mass of each atom that makes up each star. Except at the
> limit of external space frame contraction near black holes at galactic
> centers, the inner space frames associated with the synchronous
> projection of atomic mass are not skipped. They compensate for
> external space-time contraction at the galactic level by contracting
> internal space through fusion processes in the centers of stars at the
> solar level.
>
> Gravity is implicit in the primary projection of space-time. The
> spherical inner space of atomic matter has an orthogonal relationship
> to linear external space in each space frame. This relationship
> defines space in each space frame. Both inner and outer space are
> united as one in each conjugate quantum frame that is orthogonal to
> each space frame. These quanta of spatially indeterminate energy are
> collectively unified for all atoms as a boundless and timeless energy
> field called the Void.
>
> Together, space frames and timeless quantum frames define increments
> of space and time with each synchronous recurrence of space frames
> from the timeless Void.
>
> The boundless unity of the quantum equivalent of all matter as energy
> is expressed externally on the space frame side of each conjugate
> sequence by the gravitational contraction of external space frame by
> frame, bringing matter together. The unity of the quantum Void seeks
> conjugate reconciliation with separate atoms on the space frame side
> because atomic matter is both one and many *at the same time*. (Keep
> in mind that the timeless Void is orthogonal to each space frame.)
> Since this occurs at the atomic level with the primary projection of
> atomic matter, gravitational acceleration is distinct from
> gravitational mass. As Galileo showed, different masses fall at the
> same rate of acceleration. They are invested with inertial
> acceleration that is identical to their gravitational acceleration.

> the primary interval of time at the galactic center, where space and
> time are skipped completely at the event horizon of a black hole.
>
> This space-time profile of the galaxy is defined by the continual

> angular velocity of the galaxy's stellar population. This is evidenced
> by the relatively constant angular velocity of star systems around the
> galactic center. Their period is a function of their distance from the
> galactic center but not their velocity. Stars migrate along and
> through the spiral arms because their gravitational mass is distinct
> from their inertial velocity as evidenced by Foucault's pendulum and
> Mach's principle.
>
> The centers of galaxies play the role of universal observer since they
> provide a universal state of relative rest, consistent with a
> preponderance of synchronicity in the universe as a whole. Galaxies
> may migrate with respect to one another but relative migration rates
> are linked to their relative angular velocities, which are linked
> hierarchically to rates of stellar formation, rotation, migration and
> lifespan.
>
> The expansion of an assumed spacetime continuum is believed to account

1)  **Cosmic Space and Time Defined:**

    a.  Space and time are universally defined at a cosmic level by the
        synchronous projection of primary hydrogen atoms. External
        linear space is defined relative to the maximum internal
        spherical space of each hydrogen atom in each space frame in
        each primary interval of time.

    b.  The primary interval of time is defined by zero angular momentum
        in the first hydrogen orbit. It is Tp=1.519x10-16 seconds.

    c.  The radius of the first orbit is the Bohr radius 5.29x10-11
        meters. The radius of the largest fully coherent atom is defined
        by the orthogonal speed of light around the circumference in a
        primary

> interval of time. It is the 12th hydrogen orbit. This is essential for
> the atom to be fully coherent and in communication with itself. It
>
> is n2 times the radius of the first orbit or 144x5.29x10-11 =
> 7.62x10-9 meters.

d.  A primary interval of external space Sp is defined by the linear
    distance light can travel externally with respect to each coherent
    atom in a primary interval of time. It is Sp=cTp =
    2.998x108x1.519x10-16 = 4.554x10-8 meters. Both space and time

> are quantized in this way. There is no other universal measuring rod
> out there in space.

2)  **Galactic Level:**

    a.  The collective stellar populations of each galaxy are in mutual
        angular motions with respect to all other galaxies. The stellar
        populations of each spiral galaxy tend to revolve at a constant
        speed about a common center. The stellar populations of
        elliptical galaxies tend to move in mutually consistent
        elliptical patterns about a common center.

    b.  The tangential inertial momentum of stellar populations in each
        galaxy is offset by gravitational attraction toward the center

> 117
>
> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I
>
> resulting in their angular motions about the center. The relative
> angular motions of galaxies prevent their collective gravitational
> collapse in much the same way that a spinning top does not fall over.
> Inertial momentum is distinct from gravitational acceleration
> consistent with Mach's principle. This is demonstrated by Foucault's
> pendulum, the gyro compass and similar phenomena.

c)  Gravitational attraction is implicit in the primary projection of
    atoms because the conjugate quantum frames of each atom are
    integrated as one in the Void while each atom is separate in each
    space frame in the same primary interval of time. Matter is unified
    as One and is also separate as Many *at the same time*. This
    ambiguity between one and many seeks resolution through
    gravitational attraction frame sequence by frame sequence. *Gravity
    is not a force transmitted through space and time*.

d)  Gravitational acceleration toward the galactic center involves the
    skipping of external space frames at the center with respect to the
    galactic periphery. It does not involve the skipping of internal
    atomic space frames from which gravitational mass derives except at
    the limit of external space-time contraction near the black hole
    center of each galaxy. Atoms remain preponderantly synchronous with
    the primary projection of hydrogen on a cosmic scale. Their angular
    velocities are relatively constant with respect to the galactic
    center, except in the accretion disc near the galactic center.

e)  The relative skipping of external space frames at various galactic
    radii with respect to the center curves the integrated fabric of
    external space-time. This gives each galaxy its own characteristic
    space-time profile. Galaxies with higher rates of revolution have
    higher relative rates of stellar evolution and larger and more
    active black holes at their centers. They have steeper external
    space-time profiles.

f)  The relative linear migration of galaxies with respect to one
    another is constrained by the need for a preponderance of
    synchronicity at a cosmic level. Higher relative migrations require
    higher angular motions and steeper space-time curvature profiles.

g)  The relative angular momentum of galaxies tends to prevent them from
    merging due to mutual gravitational attraction depending upon how
    they are mutually aligned and their relative size. Their relative
    patterns of migration are regulated according to their mutual
    alignment and their relative rates of angular

> matter at very high relative velocities far into space. This can act
> as a brake on the angular velocity of a galaxy to bring it back into
> line with preponderant synchronicity.

3)  **Solar Level:**

    a.  The curvature of the galactic space-time profile can be likened
        to the relatively flat shape of a vortex where the space-time
        curvature becomes very steep near the center until it becomes a
        black hole in the integrated fabric of space-time. The black
        hole consumes old dense stars and accumulates a corresponding
        amount of quantized energy with gravitational effects. This can
        be periodically relieved by radial ejections of primary hydrogen
        that provide feedstock for new generations of stars. It is the
        highly contracted space-time profile near the center of a spiral
        galaxy that impels primary hydrogen radially outward into the
        spiral arms. The more highly contracted space-time profile
        closer to the center is also instrumental in the contraction of
        giant hydrogen clouds into patterns of stellar accretion.

    b.  The curved space-time profile of the integrated fabric of
        spacetime is defined by the linear transmission of light from
        the atomic processes within stars that revolve around galactic
        centers.

    c.  Ejections of primary hydrogen from galactic centers are periodic
        over many millions of years and are attended by episodes of
        starburst activity.110 Many starburst galaxies are observed with
        star formation rates that can be hundreds of stars per year,
        enough to regenerate their stellar populations in a billion
        years or less if the rate was sustained.

    d.  Solar systems accrete under the contraction pressures exerted by
        the space-time curvature profile of the galaxy associated with
        gravity. The process is initiated by the galactic profile until

> 119

> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I
>
> gravitational contraction of each stellar system takes on a life of
> its own. Thermonuclear ignition takes place in the central star when
> the temperatures and gravitational contraction pressures at the solar
> center exceed critical limits. Hydrogen fusion begins. If it is a
> second generation star there may be appreciable amounts of helium and
> small amounts of heavier elements present.

e)  Fusion processes in the centre of the star continue to be driven by
    gravitational contraction pressures linked to but distinct from the
    rotational velocity of the star. Each star has a characteristic
    space-time contraction profile that is distinct from the profile for
    the galaxy.

f)  Gravity holds the star together, keeping it from flying apart due to
    its inertial angular momentum. Its rotational inertial velocity
    necessarily results in space-frame skipping at the center of the
    star with respect to its peripheral regions. This space-frame
    skipping must be accounted for to maintain the synchronicity of
    gravitational mass on a cosmic level. This is compensated for by the
    nuclear fusion processes that contract space-time at stellar
    centers.

g)  Space frame skipping can also be translated into a force of
    retardation at the center with respect to the periphery and the
    peripheral planets. If the combined effects of fusion processes and
    the quantum force of retardation can not keep pace with a
    preponderance of synchronicity, rapidly rotating stars can eject
    matter axially from their poles in an analogous manner to active
    galactic nuclei. This mechanism drives pulsars.

h)  Space frame skipping at the stellar level represents an ongoing
    contraction pressure just as the angular velocity of a galaxy
    maintains a relatively constant space-time curvature profile. The
    star system contraction of internal space-time seeks a balance with
    the galactic external space-time curvature according to its relative
    position and distance from the galactic center. The space-time
    profile of the galaxy will tend to regulate stellar migration by
    quantum forces accordingly. The quantum forces are implicit in the
    synchronous projection of matter, space frame by space frame. They
    do not act through space-time.

i)  Fusion processes at stellar centers generate energy sufficient to
    strip most electrons leaving ionized atoms of significantly
    contracted effective volumes. A higher degree of atomic packing can
    occur as a result. This is resisted by radiation pressure and the
    associated energies of free electrons.

> 120
>
> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I

j)  Neutrons generated by fusion processes provide a high degree of
    spatial contraction with a corresponding high degree of nucleon
    packing. The neutron contraction ratio is more than 15 orders of
    magnitude.

k)  A portion of highly energized electrons and protons escape the sun
    in the solar wind that bathes the planets out to the heliopause
    where the solar magnetosphere meets the interstellar medium.

4)  **Planetary Level:**

    a.  The solar system as a whole has a space-time profile that is
        subsumed within the space-time profile of the galaxy. The
        planets all revolve around the sun in the same direction and in
        roughly the same equatorial plane. They are held in their orbits
        by gravitational acceleration toward the sun. This contracts
        external space-time in a similar way that it does for a galaxy,
        except that the contraction relates to the sun at the center and
        not to a black hole. This means that orbiting planets that
        accreted from the same swirling cloud of gas and dust as the sun
        may also contribute to space-frame skipping that drives or
        regulates fusion processes in the sun.

    b.  Planets rotate on their axis and most have moons so there is a
        level of space-frame skipping at the centers of planets with
        respect to their peripheries that defines another subsumed
        spacetime profile at the planetary level. This results in
        patterns of quantum forces in analogous ways that they regulate
        the migrations of stars.

    c.  The focus in planets is on chemical synthesis and internal
        dynamical patterns that compensate for space-frame skipping at
        the center with respect to the periphery. This results in
        dynamical surface patterns in planets as well as in some moons
        that respond to internally generated quantum forces

    d.  On Earth this fuels plate tectonics, ocean currents, atmospheric
        dynamics and it is also linked to subsumed levels of biological
        evolution consistent with Systems 4 and higher.

    e.  There is a related effect on the Earth's magnetosphere that
        reverses polarity every few hundred thousand years.

5)  **Galactic Space-Time Profile:**

    a.  There is evidence that the angular velocity of stars across most
        of our galactic radius is relatively constant at about 230
        kilometers per second regardless of their distance from the
        center. Their

> 121
>
> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I
>
> period of revolution changes with distance from the center, not their
> velocity. This is consistent with the synchronous projection of matter
> as prescribed by System 3. Stars migrate through the spiral arms that
> act somewhat like traffic jam back ups.

b)  In a discontinuous universe stars will necessarily have radial
    migrations such that they seek to balance the contraction of
    external space-time with their accumulated internal contraction of
    space-time due to fusion processes. Radial migration is driven frame
    by frame by quantum forces that derive from the need for a
    preponderance of synchronicity. Space-time phenomena are
    synchronously coherent and appear seamless.

c)  The quantum forces that determine radial migration rates and
    direction depend upon the accumulated contraction ratio of the star
    as a whole over its lifetime of fusion processes at its center as
    compared to primary hydrogen. If this internal contraction ratio has
    proceeded to a lesser extent than the contraction of external space
    frames due to gravitational acceleration toward the galactic center
    then the star will tend to migrate radially outward away from the
    galactic center. If the internal contraction ratio has proceeded to
    a greater extent than the external contraction ratio of the galactic
    profile then the star will tend to migrate back inward back toward
    the galactic center.

d)  At some point in the life of a star a balance will be achieved
    between internal and external space-time contraction. At this point
    the star may possess a degree of radial inertial momentum outward
    from the galactic center but the quantum forces that regulates
    migration rate will tend to cease then reverse. This may account for
    backups in the spiral arms. As fusion processes proceed further the
    star will eventually reverse direction and migrate back toward the
    galactic center.

e)  The ratio of external space frames skipped to those not skipped is a
    function of *v/c* where *v* is the angular speed of the star around
    the galaxy and *c* is the speed of light Since the angular stellar
    velocity is known to be relatively constant at approximately 230
    km/second, the ratio of external space frames skipped in the
    galactic plane is 230/3x108=7.67x10-6.

f)  This requires younger stars that have accumulated a lesser
    contraction ratio as a result of fusion processes to migrate
    radially outwards. Older stars that have accumulated a greater
    contraction ratio will migrate back towards the center where
    relative external space frame skipping is greatest.

> upper left hand quadrant of the world box on historic coordinates.111

6)  **Solar Space-Time Profile:**

    a.  Our sun constitutes 99% of the mass of the solar system but only
        98% of the angular momentum. This is the opposite to what should
        have happened as the solar system accreted according to
        traditional physics. Skaters spin faster as they pull their
        extended arms into their sides. The center should rotate faster
        than the periphery.

    b.  The planets are comparatively great distances from the sun and
        are orbiting at higher velocities than the rotation of the sun.
        Earth for example is about 149.6 million kilometers from the sun
        on average and has an orbital velocity of 29.8 km/sec. This is
        much higher than the orbital velocity of the sun at its equator,
        even though there is much less mass involved. The equator of the
        sun also rotates every 25 days while the poles through its
        center rotate slower at 33 days.

d.  Since the orbital angular momentum of a planet is proportional to
    the square of the radius this tends to invest the planets with most
    of the angular momentum even though the sun is over a hundred times
    larger than all the planets combined. Gravity holds the planets in
    orbit and contracts or curves the fabric of external space in
    dynamic patterns accordingly. Nevertheless any

>
> effect of the planets on fusion processes in the sun's center is small
> and may be neglected for our purposes. This is a fair assumption since
> fusion processes are dependent on gravitational contraction associated
> with solar size irrespective of orbiting planets.

e)  We can assume that it is the sun revolving on its own axis that
    contracts space-frames associated with fusion processes. We can also
    assume consistent with Mach's principle that the inertial rotational
    velocity of the sun is distinct from its gravitational mass.

f)  To arrive at approximate limiting values we can assume that the
    velocity of the solar equator determines the outer limit of the
    inner solar space-time profile.

g)  The equator rotates in 25 days. The sun is about 1.4 million
    kilometers in diameter so the equator has an angular velocity of
    1.4x106п/25x24x3600= 2.03 kilometers per second. This represents a
    rate of space frame skipping at the center of v/c=2.03/3.0 x 108, or
    6.77 x 10-9. This skipping rate is continual and thus represents a
    continual curvature gradient that alters only as the sun evolves
    over very long periods of time.

7)  **Nuclear Fusion and Stellar Space-time Contraction:**

    a.  According to current astrophysical theories fusion processes
        proceed in stages as hydrogen fuel is consumed and progressively
        heavier elements are employed as fuel up to iron. As the star
        contracts in stages it generates more heat from the
        gravitational contraction. This proceeds with the fused products
        of a prior stage acting as fuel for each succeeding stage until
        the end product of fusion in a star like our sun is iron. The
        star then shrinks to a white dwarf and cools over time to a
        dense inactive black dwarf. Stars that are more than a few times
        larger than our sun go through their life cycles faster and end
        in a supernova that produces the heavier elements up to uranium.
        They leave a super-dense neutron star or perhaps a black hole at
        their center.

    b.  The space-time contraction can be computed at various stages in
        a star's life according to estimated percentages of various
        elements. To make it easy and still demonstrate a principle the
        contraction ratios of only six typical elements in the fusion
        stages will be considered, namely Helium 4He, Carbon 12C, Neon

> 20Ne, Magnesium 24Mg, Sulfur 32S, and Iron 56Fe.
>
> 124
>
> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I

c)  The contraction ratios can be computed as follows assuming that
    atoms above helium near the center of the sun are stripped of their
    electrons down to the first obit. The effective volume of the atom
    is the volume of the first orbit, which is proportional to the
    inverse of the atomic number cubed times the volume of the first
    orbit of hydrogen. The atomic number is the number of electrons in a
    neutral atom. Dividing by the atomic weight, taken as the number of
    nucleons of unit weight 1, gives the contraction density as a ratio
    to primary hydrogen. Since neutrons contract space by a very large
    factor with respect to the primary hydrogen atom we can double the
    atomic number for computing contraction ratios for these typical
    elements. Since we are computing the ratio of contraction with
    respect to hydrogen taken as 1, the actual volume is not
    significant.

> 9.54x10-7 Ratio for Iron = (1/52)3/56 = 1.27x10-7

d)  It is clear that the first orbit of hydrogen is huge with respect to
    the volume of a nucleon. The Bohr radius of the first hydrogen orbit
    is 5.3x 10-11 meters. The volume of the first orbit is 6.24x10-29
    cubic meters. By comparison the volume of a neutron or proton is
    about 7.24x10-45 cubic meters or about 8.62x1015 times smaller.
    There is lots of room for spatial contraction.

    a.  By assuming different stellar compositions at successive stages
        in the life of a typical star like our sun the total contraction
        of space-time in the star can be compared with the galactic
        spacetime profile. This can tell us whether there is a tendency
        for the star to migrate outwards toward the periphery or back
        inwards towards the center.

    b.  Our sun is currently estimated to consist of 75% hydrogen, 23 %
        helium and about 2% heavier elements, which shall be assumed to
        be carbon, to keep things easy.

c)  Helium has a contraction ratio of 3.93x10-3. This means that the
    volume of 1/3.91x10-3 = 256 hydrogen atoms have been contracted into
    the effective volume of each atom of helium. Since 23 % of the sun
    is helium this represents a percentage contraction ratio of 23x256=
    5,888 hydrogen atom equivalents.

d)  Carbon has a contraction ratio of 4.82x10-5 or 20,750 hydrogen atom
    equivalents. Taking 2% of the sun to be carbon this

> represents a percentage contraction ratio of 41,500 hydrogen atom
> equivalents.

e)  This means that a total of 75+5,888+41,500 = 47,463 hydrogen atom
    equivalents are contracted into the volume of 100 atoms. There is a
    gross contraction ratio in our star of 100/47,463= 2.1x10-3.

f)  Comparing this contraction ratio with that for the galaxy in point
    5(e) above we see that the atomic contraction ratio of our sun is
    less than that for the external space-time profile of the galaxy
    which is 7.67x10-6. This discrepancy between the internal atomic
    contraction of spherical space-time and the external linear
    contraction of space-time in the galaxy results in a quantum force
    that impels the sun radially outward space frame by space frame. It
    means there is a higher relative skipping of external space-frames
    at that point in the galactic radius. But there is a complementary
    higher relative accumulation of atomic quantum frames associated
    with the sun that can be translated into a quantum force that acts
    against the gravitational attraction toward the black hole center.

g)  ![](images/cosmordall/media/image114.png){width="0.13999890638670165in"
    height="1.3086111111111112in"}We can assume a different atomic
    composition for a more mature star that has used up most of its
    hydrogen fuel. To demonstrate a principle let us arbitrarily say
    that it is 20% hydrogen, 25% helium, 20% carbon, 12% neon, 10%
    magnesium, 9% sulfur and 4% iron. The equivalent hydrogen atoms will
    be the reciprocal contraction ratio times the percentage composition
    as follows:

> Hydrogen = 1/1x20 = 20 Helium = 1/3.91x10-3 x 25 = 6,394 Carbon =
> 1/4.82x10-5 x 20 = 414,938
>
> Neon = 1/6.25x10-6 x 12 = 1,920,000
>
> Magnesium = 1/3.01x10-6 x10 = 3,322,259 Sulfur = 1/9.54x10-7 x 9 =
> 9,433,962 Iron = 1/1.27x10-7 x 4 = 31,496,063

h)  Total equivalent hydrogen atoms = 46,593,636

> 126
>
> SCIENCE AND COSMIC ORDER BOOK I

i)  The gross accumulated contraction ratio is 100/46,593,636 =
    2.14x10-6 which is more than the external contraction of galactic
    space-time in 5(e) above. There is thus a resultant quantum force
    acting to reverse the radial migration back toward the galactic
    center space frame by space frame. Although the chosen percentage
    components of the star are purely arbitrary, stars achieve higher
    concentrations of heavier elements later in their life cycles. The
    example serves to demonstrate that the gross internal contraction
    ratios of old stars, especially black dwarfs and neutron stars, can
    easily exceed the external contraction of space-time in the galactic
    space-time profile.

3.  This requires an altogether different cosmological perspective than
    the one which has developed. Time and again the main contributors to
    the theory came within a hair's breadth of actually stating that the
    entire physical universe is discontinuous and synchronous, including
    Planck, Bohr, Heisenberg, Born, de Broglie, Shrödinger, even
    Einstein with his quantum explanation of the photoelectric effect.
    They all in effect made this assumption without actually going so
    far as to state it in so many words. By taking that one small step
    we find ourselves with the same hand of cards in a very different
    game.

> Preface
>
> This book is about the cosmic order. It is therefore about the
> *System* of organization that underlies the whole of experience. It is
> about the creative process and the whole of creation.
>
> In the main, humanity's scientific and spiritual pursuits have led to
> divergent perspectives of creation. The *System* that is introduced
> here indicates that these two pursuits are essential complements of
> one another in our search for an understanding of our natural heritage
> through an evolutionary record that reaches back billions of years.
> The deciphering of the *System* can help us to read the record, not
> only in the biosphere, the planets, the stars, and distant galaxies,
> but also in the structure of our bodies and in the workings of our
> nervous systems. The System can help us to see our part and place in
> relation to the whole.
>
> The book should be of interest to any reasonably informed reader who
> has ever seriously reflected on the meaning of life. It should be of
> special interest to any who have followed the dialogue of science,
> even in a modest way. The book, however, is not confined to science.
> It clarifies how we integrate everyday experience, and how this
> relates to our evolution in the biosphere. It includes a review of
> history, it touches on ancient systems of understanding, and it
> assesses the problems of organization in the business world. Most
> important the book is about the wilderness and fishing.

#### Overture

> In the three centuries since Newton, science has skyrocketed like a
> fireworks display that in this century has exploded into nearly every
> area of human experience. The fragments of the spectacular display
> have not yet lost their brilliance, but still hang suspended as a
> great blossom of light, holding sway over man's mind as we marvel at
> the pageant that we have created for ourselves. In the fascination
> with such a display one seldom pays attention to the grandstand, even
> though the brilliance of the show may illuminate the whole
> environment. The fragments cool and lose their luster, then flutter
> back to earth in darkness as the audience stumbles homeward with only
> memories of a moment left behind.
>
> It's been over two thousand years since our last fireworks display in
> the golden age of Greece, and it was a long period of darkness in
> between. Already there are signs that the energies of the current show
> are waning, and one wonders if we must soon fumble through another age
> of darkness. But the scale and magnitude of this extravaganza threaten
> planetary bankruptcy. Perhaps we will not be able to afford another
> show. Perhaps for evermore we will have to stumble on in darkness
> through the ashes, half animal, half man, not knowing who we are, but
> worse: knowing that we had a chance and lost it. Perhaps it is not too
> late to look around and while the light is good, kindle some enduring
> flames.

#### Prologue

> I had phoned ahead and made reservations. It was a good job that I
> did. I would have been sleeping on the beach with quite a few others.
> Pee Pee Island has become very crowded ever since they made the movie
> there--- *The Beach*, with Leonardo Di Caprio. There was a big fuss
> about it in the news, because they temporarily transplanted sixty palm
> trees and changed the face of an uninhabited island to make it look
> more pristine. You should have seen it fifteen years ago, before
> tourist traffic killed the coral in Maya Bay and left tons of garbage
> around. Spectacular. Cliffs soaring straight out of the sea a thousand
> feet. The cliffs are still there, but it's not the same.
>
> It wasn't just me that was a little bewildered by it all. A five meter
> python had crawled out of the jungle into the village one night. I
> guess it wanted to see what all the fuss was about, only to be
> mesmerized by throngs of people. It was right beside the main footpath
> and it stayed there all day, sticking its tongue out at passersby.
> Fortunately someone happened along who knew something about pythons,
> and by enlisting a few deputies, carted it up a hill back into the
> jungle. It weighed sixty pounds.
>
> There have been great changes in Asia, since I first came to this part
> of the world, twenty years ago---big developments, you might say.
>
> Western technology, industry and commerce have invaded like a storm.
> Thai-land has become a newly industrialized country, an NIC in the
> slick vernacular of the economic world. You can see it most clearly in
> Bangkok. Thousands of skyscrapers have sprung up like a well manured
> patch of nettles. There is a sting to it all. While girded glass
> fingers stretch for the sky, the price of land has soared beyond the
> reach of all but a few. Two economies have emerged, one inflated for
> the rich, one depressed for the poor. Amid the pollution choked
> arteries that feed the beast, the numbers of street children increase
> in proportion to the GNP. Why is it that our technology provides such
> a capacity for wealth, while impoverishing so many? Why is it that our
> material well being so often leaves us morally and spiritually
> indifferent? Why is it that our accumulation of knowledge so often
> sharpens our wits while eroding our understanding?
>
> A new insight into the cosmic order is presented here in an effort to
> broaden our understanding of the knowledge that we have accumulated

viii. *Fisherman's Guide*

> over the last few centuries, especially the explosion of scientific
> knowledge about the world that we live in. Better ways have been found
> to describe the cosmic order than in the original *Fisherman's Guide*,
> published by Shambhala in 1985. The same background is covered, the
> same signs and signals are here, but they are more clearly and
> directly focused. The role of the cosmic order---the System as it is
> called---is accented as it works within each of us. In a similar way,
> this includes our social and economic organization, through which we
> relate to the natural world. We shall see that the same cosmic order
> keeps recurring in different disguises. Because of the way the cosmic
> order works, all phenomena are ordered in a self-similar way.
>
> The sharper focus is due in some measure to my prolonged exposure to
> Asian cultures, and of course to just more years of experience upon
> which to draw. This period has also included a few more years working
> in remote oil fields of the Libyan Sahara, and more exposure to
> sub-Saharan Africa and India.
>
> Throughout this time I have assiduously maintained my studies of
> various branches of science in depth. I keep abreast of significant
> developments at the forefront of the physical and biological sciences.
> These labors are directed at better translating and communicating the
> cosmic order, as it was so awesomely demonstrated in a revelatory
> experience thirty years ago. Other insights followed to assist in that
> direction.
>
> Insight must find translation in socially meaningful ways. The cosmic
> order works this way. It relates to the explicit social order apparent
> around us---our knowledge---as well as it does to the spiritual order
> implicit in experience---our understanding. It seeks an intelligent
> balance between these two perspectives. We shall see that
> understanding is de-pendent upon direct intuitive insight, while
> explicit social expression is dependent upon knowledge assimilated
> through language.
>
> There are really three perspectives involved in the balance, because
> right brain intuitive insight and left brain social expression are
> fueled by emotional energy generated by our autonomic nervous system.
> The latter is ancient. We have evolved up through the species of the
> natural world, according to the workings of the cosmic order itself,
> progressively integrating developments explored by our vertebrate
> ancestors into the structure of our nervous systems. We shall explore
> more fully how we are hard wired to our evolutionary history through
> our emotional apparatus. Emotion fuels our mute intuitive perceptions
> that socially

ix. *Prologue*

> direct our rational intellect. We thus have three sides constrained to
> live in the same house together, and we often don't get along with
> ourselves.
>
> Every human being functions in three mutually related arenas at the
> same time. We are much more than the transient individuals that we
> often mistake ourselves for. One arena is our historically integrated
> past that sustains our energy needs in our organic bodies. This arena
> is built on foundations going back four billion years. We not only see
> our evolutionary heritage around us in nature, we experience it within
> our bodies. We are very old.
>
> The second arena is a timeless and transcendent spiritual reality that
> regulates our intuitive access to the cosmic order through which we
> have evolved, and continue to evolve. All of us have moments of
> inspiration sometimes, mute insights or intuitive energy patterns that
> lead us to integrate our experience in certain ways that tend not to
> change over time. They can often provide guiding direction throughout
> a lifetime.
>
> Sometimes we are born with strong intuitive direction. Sometimes we
> may acquire it in various degrees, or both may happen. We are not only
> very old, we also have a timeless quality about us.
>
> The third arena is our need to relate in practical ways to our
> immediate social environment. We are often led by short term interests
> in this respect, but hopefully also in ways that are emotionally
> balanced to some extent with mute perceptions of the cosmic order
> through which we have arrived where we are. In any case, we recreate
> ourselves as we please every minute of our lives, according to how we
> make our commitments. Even our body replaces itself in a matter of
> months. We are old; we are eternal; we are also very young. It is hard
> to say exactly what we human beings are. We are one part animal, one
> part divine, one part human.
>
> Our modern science and technology that is having such an impact on our
> lives and the world that we live in is a social phenomenon that was
> born in Western culture. Its seeds were planted in ancient Greece and
> took fifteen hundred years to germinate during the renaissance,
> maturing into full bloom during this century. The seeds were simple
> little concepts, a brief imperfect glimpse of one face of the cosmic
> order, and they proliferated in the weed ridden garden of the social
> arena.
>
> We tend to take for granted the influence that science has on our
> lives, even though it has drastically altered our social orientation
> in a few generations. We have recreated ourselves as a species, minute
> by minute, by our social commitment to science. Leading this
> commitment are those few very tenuous insights into the nature of the
> cosmic order, and despite

x.  *Fisherman's Guide*

> modifications and alterations to suit in the process of maturing, they
> continue to prevail in guiding the general thrust of our social
> commitment to science. We have unwittingly shown great trust in a few
> abstract principles that would now seek to render us captive forever.
> In recent decades sciences has been striving to write a new bible
> about the way things are and work, with the hope of closing the book
> for all people for all time. Our transient social orientation seeks
> eternal status.
>
> But science is not an isolated arena of human experience. It is not an
> ivory tower that is sacrosanct unto the scientific community. Science
> cannot claim immunity from public scrutiny, nor can it act with
> impunity. Our science and technology has a powerful influence on how
> we all think and behave. Not a human being on the planet has been left
> untouched by the relentless march of science.
>
> The whole of science thus comes under the microscope when we begin to
> speak of the cosmic order. During the last couple of centuries, and
> especially in this one, there has been a strong tendency for science
> to monopolize the microscope for itself. Religion and philosophy have
> both been elbowed aside. Those ancient seeds, planted over two
> millennia ago, have been force fed into a new cosmological view of the
> universe. Science wants to outgrow its social shackles and claim
> ascendancy as the sole author of the cosmic order. This might not be
> so bad if it did not reduce the whole of the universe, including all
> sentient beings that may have arisen within it, to a meaningless
> accident arising from less than nothing, completely devoid of
> universal values or purpose.
>
> Before some of us jump to condemn science for its efforts, or others
> to defend its eternal achievements, it must be acknowledged that this
> tendency to self supremacy has been prevalent throughout human
> history. "I'm the king of the castle and you're the dirty rascal."
> We've been clubbing each other for millennia over this deadly game. We
> all still play at this silly game, so it's not surprising to see
> science and religion playing at it also. We have not progressed very
> far from the sand pile, and making one or the other out to be rascal
> or king will resolve nothing.
>
> Religion and philosophy are such woolly affairs. Science is woolly at
> its roots too, but it gives us clear practical results, like cars and
> television sets. It sends men to the moon, so it must deal in facts
> and truth, right? Its remarkable achievements are undeniable. For this
> reason it has attracted a large following of true believers. Nobody
> likes woolliness, not even the religious believers among us.
>
> Our efforts to exclude woolliness from our lives have engaged us in a
> considerable degree of hair splitting over the centuries. In science
> this

xi. *Prologue*

> has taken us inside the atom through the splitting of spectral lines,
> and on to what happens in the centers of stars and galaxies. On the
> religious front, the Christian bible has been dissected into scores of
> differing interpretations. The Hindu systems are probably the most
> prolific, having generated seemingly endless interpretations. Then the
> Theravada Buddhist Tipitaka is itself forty volumes, with many more
> volumes of commentary, and a still burgeoning volume of literature
> besides. Even the Muslim Koran has ranks of commentaries engaging in
> regimental hair splitting, trying to steer it out of woolly terrain in
> its long march forward.
>
> These hairs concern the nature of identity, of self and other, one and
> many, universal and particular. We shall be exploring this ground in
> detail with good reason. Wars are fought over these hairs. They are a
> matter of life and death. More. They concern one's psychic integrity,
> or perhaps one's psychic annihilation. Nothing is more important than
> these hairs. All human conflict revolves around them, all values, all
> realization. The human social challenge is to reconcile these hairs
> between self and other. But woolliness is abhorrent to us. We feel
> eroded by its indefiniteness about who we are. We rationalize in words
> and want to frame the dilemma in language, enshrine it as immutable
> truth on a piece of paper, make a stand to say who we are. We don't
> like woolliness.
>
> Neither did Pontius Pilate at the trial. He did not want to convict,
> but he could not get a satisfactory answer from the accused. Only
> silence. Then he washed his hands. These words and this hair splitting
> are the crucifixion. Likewise the Buddha was pressed on various
> occasions about the identity of the self, and the existence of God.
> Only silence in response. He is also reported to have made a woolly
> response known as the quadrilemma: *'Is, is not, both is and is not,
> neither is nor is not.'* He likewise explicitly denied that he denied
> the self, even though he taught that you cannot explicitly identify a
> self. You cannot isolate it, put it in a box and gift wrap it, so to
> speak. Everything is interdependent. *Anattã* means *not-self*, not
> *no-self*. Strange how religions get twisted over hair splitting, or
> the lack of it.
>
> In the original version I leaned heavily on the word isomorphy, but
> this word has now been largely replaced by "self-similarity." It is a
> more accessible term and it relates more directly to the problem of
> identity.
>
> The woolliness can more readily be seen to revolve around it. We shall
> see that there are obvious hierarchies permeating the natural order.
> We shall also see that each level in a hierarchy has a hierarchy
> within it that is self-similar to the whole hierarchy. So the
> woolliness cannot be

xii. *Fisherman's Guide*

> resolved by saying things are this way as opposed to that. A
> journalistic approach can't accomplish the task. Reality can't be
> reduced to neutral facts, nor can logic untie the knots within knots.
> It can only be resolved by making the creative process transparent, so
> that anyone can see through the endless hair splitting for themselves.
> The woolliness is not rationally resolved. It simply evaporates in the
> process of becoming transparent.
>
> Rendering it thus is a far from easy task. But I believe I have found
> ways to approach the problem in a reasonably accessible fashion that
> most average readers should see, or at least glimpse sufficiently to
> make them wonder deeply and sharpen their intuition. In this respect
> the revisions are a big improvement over the original version.
>
> The focus on science is thus not intended to condemn our scientific
> efforts, nor to dispense arbitrarily with its achievements or
> conclusions, any more than it is intended to dispense arbitrarily with
> the spiritual essence of the world's religious traditions. On the
> contrary, science has provided us with a fund of knowledge and factual
> evidence that now makes it possible for a more profound insight into
> the cosmic order to emerge from hiding under layers of language.
>
> Language itself can be one of the impediments in this effort, so an
> assist is provided through the non-linguistic means employed to
> delineate the cosmic order as the *System*. The seeds that were
> planted in ancient Greece are accounted for by the *System*, but they
> are placed in a much more fundamental context, opening up new horizons
> for the whole of science. Moreover these horizons are no longer
> inconsistent with the essence of the world's religions. Perspective
> within each of these separate arenas may become mutually complementary
> and mutually balanced. The *System* can provide a bridge between them

#### Chapter 1 Night Fishing

> The boat rocks gently to the rhythmic beat of waves against its hull.
> It's the kind of soft hypnotic roll that brings a certain harmony to a
> contemplative mood. The sharp-crested ripplets that have been stirred
> by a mild evening breeze are beginning to mellow at last. Soon they
> will be no more than glimmering shadows blinking a mottled dance on a
> slippery surface.
>
> At this time of year, the pattern is the same each night. It is a
> ritual perfected through countless centuries of repetition, yet each
> occurrence preserves the freshness of a premier performance. There is
> an insistence to the stillness that settles here each evening---the
> world holding its breath in anticipation of the coming night. It
> penetrates the being, making all thought seem redundant and strangely
> out of place. The stillness can be seen vibrating in the air. There is
> an immediacy to it that makes one feel they can reach out and touch
> it. There is peace, but it is a peace that is vital, filled with
> energy and alive. The crickets and frogs have started now to tantalize
> the stillness, which stands out the more. The sun has set, and the
> remnants of color are rapidly draining from the sky. A first few stars
> have penetrated the encroaching darkness.
>
> The boat is anchored in nine or ten feet of water, about fifty feet
> from underwater rocks that extend about forty feet in diameter. Just
> at dusk the mosquitoes can get bad for a short while, but tonight
> there are only a few. The bass should be feeding on the surface now.
> The stillness is broken by a quiet reach for the fishing rod. On the
> surface, plunkers are as good as any, and tonight a hula popper will
> get its chance. Darkness is coming quickly. The wooded shoreline looms
> like a ghost looking at itself in the water.
>
> Smallmouth bass have a habit of surface feeding at night. Although not
> many are caught at one time, they are usually a nice size. The first
> cast is directly over the center of the rock pile. The rocks are
> covered by only a foot or two of water in most places, although well
> out from shore and surrounded by deeper water. In the fading light,

> as it lands and generates a series of concentric ripples. The high
> arch of the line plummets to the surface, marring its perfection. The
> plug bobs to a standstill and sits there for a moment. The slack in
> the line is taken up, and the popper jiggled just a little. Another
> smaller series of circles grows, and another. Often bass have to be
> teased into biting by this gentle jiggling. Now the pole is jerked
> sharply to one side. There is a solidsounding plunk, and the popper
> bobs back to the surface. Now a wait in anticipation, but no takers.
> More gentle jiggling and another more moderate plunk. There is a sharp
> sounding snap, but from a small rock bass hitting short on the rubber
> skirt. Soon the plug is near the boat and reeled in to throw again.
> Several more casts attract only some small fry. Maybe there will be no
> action tonight.
>
> Another cast tries for a run over one side of the rock pile. The
> instant the plug lands a very loud splash signals a strike. It must be
> a nice one, although it is too dark to see. The slack line is
> frantically reeled up. Sometimes, before one can get a taut line, they
> will swim straight for the boat, break water, and shake the hooks. The
> slack is caught up just in time. The fish feels heavy as it clears the
> water, shaking furiously. No sooner is it back in the water than it is
> out again. It breaks water several times in succession, then starts
> digging for the bottom, taking line. The tension adjustment is
> tightened up a little. The fish comes up again quickly to provide a
> glimpse. A nice one! Down again it goes, digging for the bottom and
> heading toward the anchor rope. An attempt to horse it a bit to keep
> it away is too late. Around the rope once, a little slack line, and
> the fish is gone.
>
> Too bad, perhaps, but there is no point in feeling remorse at losing a
> fish. The anchor is lifted and the hula-popper retrieved from the
> anchor rope. Fortunately the line isn't broken. There is nothing to do
> now but settle back across the seat to let the stillness once more
> take command.
>
> The night is clear. The air is moist and fresh. Gazing into the cosmos
> brings back amazement at the spectacle of grandeur unfolded before the
> eyes. The feeling is remembered from early boyhood, with wonder that
> it has not changed in so many years. Some two hundred thousand million
> suns in our galaxy alone. Such numbers cannot register its true
> immensity. Only a few thousand can be seen with the naked eye. The

> The rain has passed to leave the promise of a nice day, but everything

> sleep has run its course. A little exercise is good to get the vital
> juices flowing; a thirty minute run is followed by a swim.

> After breakfast the hill behind the cottage is climbed, and a
> comfortable looking rock is chosen for a seat. The morning air is

> The attention gravitates to the spectacle of life, abounding with
> variety, singing a common song. A few birds are trying out the freedom

> fluttering by in typical erratic fashion. It comes to within a few

> integrated. The new head office bureaucracy wanted to centralize all
> operations without adequate regard for fundamental differences in the
> two companies. They were a large, predominantly rural, sprawling
> company. We were a concentrated urban company. The communicative
> requirements between our operating parts were different. Many of the
> things that they wanted to do were simply not practical and we would
> lose control of a situation that we had struggled long and hard to
> cope with. Some one had to be responsible.
>
> I thus found myself a central figure in a political battle that ensued

> didn't have to live with the consequences of their own decisions. But
> I had human resources at my disposal and during the last year of this
> period, as the struggle became very intense, I undertook a detailed
> study of all formal communications in the entire company, in an effort
> to show decisively that the system they wanted to impose wouldn't
> work.
>
> During this period of intensive analysis, including self analysis, an

>
> This wasn't a linear process of cause and effect. It was a cyclic
> process. The goal transformed to a consequence that enriched the means
> in recurrent cycles, even while each of the three aspects of the
> primary activity remained an independent focus of any creative
> endeavor. So it wasn't linear through time and space. It integrated
> the history of its own development. It integrated what we think of as
> time and space and there were any number of ways that this could
> occur. I was very taken by the dynamics and implications of this
> intuitive pattern to experience generally. It focused my attention in
> a new way and I began to see implications in the natural order of

>
> At this time, I made the briefest contact with the work of J. G.

>
> The harmony of breathing gradually enveloped my whole body with a

1.  *The Potential Dimension:* Idea Development in a company is
    concerned with the development of its products. It may be an
    Engineering Department, or a Research Department, but regardless of
    the kind of company there will always be some such activity. The
    development of an idea, if it is to have real potential, always
    takes place within the context of the resource capacity available to
    make it a reality, and this is the concern of the Treasury
    Department. For example a small machine shop obviously does not have
    the resource capacity to develop a new automobile, although it may
    readily develop certain automobile parts. This polar relationship
    between the idea and the resources available to bring it to fruition
    is the *only* way to see into the *potential* of a company.

> It is also the only way for a human being to see into one's own
> creative potential, but one's resource capacity isn't restricted to
> one's bank account, nor are ideas confined to the commercial market
> place. The development of truly creative ideas is a highly intuitive
> process that is generally impossible to reduce to words or logic. It
> is an implicit right brain function, and it is funded by a treasury of
> wonder that accesses a wealth of human experience.

2.  *The Commitment Dimension:* In a company of any size, the production
    of a product or service requires many employees and they must be

    cannot assess the performance of a company by looking at a sales
    chart. The chart may indicate nothing more than market trends.
    Typewriter sales have fallen off drastically with the advent of
    computers and all of the commitment in the world to making and
    selling more typewriters won't reverse the trend. The Sales
    Department functions within the context of the Marketing Department
    and it is the Sales Marketing polarity that provides an insight into
    the performance dimension. Marketing is not properly concerned with
    selling. It is concerned with assessing market needs in light of the
    company's potential ability to meet those needs. It is concerned
    with appropriately identifying product trends and customers' needs
    in the market place. Marketing gives direction to the whole company
    and without an independent focus in this area a company performs
    blind. Sales must relate to market need.

4.  *Vital energies* of plants implicitly give form to body *form* and
    direction to biochemical structure.

> This hierarchy is universal in System 4 of the cosmic order. We may
> call System 4 *the primary creative process*.

#### Chapter 7 Three Mergansers

> It is a hot sunny day---the last chance to get some fishing in before
> heading north. The boat is drifting slowly in a large shallow bay that
> extends from one side of the creek that was fished the other day. The
> water is only five or six feet deep. The bay provides ideal feeding
> ground for pike and also lends itself to casting, for the weeds are
> not plentiful enough to create a problem. The boat is paddled a couple
> of hundred feet, then allowed to drift while the circle around the
> boat is cast, then paddled some more, and so on. The lure, a red and
> white spoon about three inches long, is usually retrieved in spurts,
> with a rhythmic motion of the pole. This enhances the lure's action,
> also breaking any tendency to spin in one direction and twist the
> line.
>
> Pike are loners who often range lazily in shallow water on sunny
> afternoons. A cast is placed beyond a patch of underwater ferns so
> that the lure will pass along one side. It is beginning to look like
> another dry run when a good sized one comes out of nowhere, hitting
> only twenty feet from the boat. It strikes viciously, running about
> fifty feet before coming to a stop, then it takes off again. It is
> headed toward the open lake. The direction of drift is fortunate for
> this one will take some time to land. Now it is dragging in heavily,
> angling to one side, and coming to the surface. Its tail breaks water
> in a flutter, sending spray flying, as it snakes out of sight like a
> rocket. Another good run, and it coasts to a stop. Again it begins to
> drag in heavily.
>
> The pattern is always the same with big northerns. A sight to behold
> when they take off on a run, they soon tire, dragging back while they
> conserve strength for another run. It is a process of gradually
> wearing them down. With light tackle, it is wise not to bring them
> close to the boat until their strength is spent, but it is essential
> to keep the line taut and the pole bent at all times. The idea is to
> play the fish at a moderate distance, working it closer as it tires. A
> couple of times it tries to hug the bottom and pull away steadily,
> then it reverts to the run and drag pattern.

82. *Fisherman's Guide*

> Gradually it can be felt weakening. A few more runs and it begins to
> turn belly up. It makes another short run close to the boat, but now
> it is done. Brought in from the left, it is scooped into the net,
> which is large, two feet across the mouth, but none too large for this
> fish. It is a very nice northern, a shade over three feet and well
> built, maybe fourteen pounds. It has taken twenty-five or thirty
> minutes to land it.
>
> It is beginning to kick around in the net. The fingers and thumb are
> worked under the gill covers on each side at the top and squeezed
> together hard. The fish becomes quite still. It was well hooked, but
> not damaged. It is held up for one last look. It returns an icy stare
> and cranks its body once. Placed gently over the side of the boat, it
> first turns belly up. A tug backwards through the water helps to
> oxygenate the gills, and the fish regains equilibrium. At first it
> glides slowly away from the boat, then it gives its tail a kick and is
> gone.
>
> That is enough of northern pike for one day. Across the lake there is
> a point where a flat rock angles into the water---a good place to go
> for a swim. The boat is headed over, pulled up on the rock, and tied
> to a bush. After a long, refreshing swim in a large circle out into
> the lake, a comfortable spot is selected where the rock slopes toward
> the sun.
>
> The heat of the rock is pleasantly moderated by the moisture from the
> swim. The sun feels like liquid life being poured over the body. The
> song of a bird echoes like an animated noise in a world without form.
>
> The eyes are inadvertently opened for a second to look directly at the
> sun, then closed again quickly. The blinding image of the sun persists
> inside the lids, gradually transforming to a negative image of
> darkness against a vermilion background. After awhile this image also
> fades. It is strange that a positive image should spontaneously
> transform into a negative image. There is a polar dynamism involved
> that brings to mind the Taoist principles of yin and yang.

> recognizes who has robbed it of it's meal; after a frantic search

> close, with angry rapid movements that show its avowed intention to

>
> The *idea* center, C1, may be associated with ongoing patterns of

> *administrative level* relating to the established infrastructure of
> the body's *cell processes* as they are organized to implicitly direct
> the body's *routines*.
>
> The *routine* center, C3, is associated with the animation of the
> body. It employs the linkages of motor nerves with the skeletal
> muscles, fueled by autonomic energies. It is concerned with the
> patterned commitment of the body's resources accordingly. It therefore

> cycles. Organs in this sense include everything from skin and sweat
> glands to muscles, heart, bowels and bone. C3 is thus a *supervisory
> level* relating to the patterned operation of *body processes* as they
> direct the body's *form*.
>
> The *form* center, C4, concerns the external form that the body takes
> as part of the external spatial form of the environment. It concerns
> the shape that the body takes in the course of enacting an animated

> primarily by the senses of sight and touch, the relative position of

> integral part of environmental form.
>
> The above identification of the four centers as they focus on the
> operation of the human nervous system may be summarized as follows:
>
> C1Electronic processes give direction to cell processes. C2Cell
> processes give direction to body processes.
>
> C3Body processes give direction to changes in body form. C4Formation

>
> There is an autonomic aspect to the hierarchy that should be pointed

>
> For the moment let us skip over the regenerative mode of the primary
> universal set in order to have a look at the goal, Term 3, of the
> primary creative process, as System 4 is called. The goal is
> accomplished through the secondary universal set, U2. It concerns the
> assimilation and translation of idea into form. It assimilates all of
> the quantized memories of the void, as elements of technique coalesced
> within ideas, that are identified by discretion as pertinent to each

> one subjectively represented by Terms 1, 4, 2, respectively, and one
> subjectively represented by Terms 8, 5, 7. They may be called
> reciprocal activities.
>
> The manner in which the mediating triangle inverts at the middle of
> each cycle, then reverts back at the end of each cycle, does more than
> regulate the transitions back and forth from the expressive to the

> THE LIMBIC CORTEX
>
> The Limbic cortex consists of the archicortex, shown in dark gray, and
> the mesocortex in light gray. These old brains form the limbus or edge
> around the inside medial surface of the newer neocortex. They are
> directly connected to the autonomic nervous system and emotion via the
> hypothalamus. The neocortex, to which we owe our intellectual
> capacity, has no direct controls over emotion. Our creative intellect,
> capable of building atomic bombs or sending rockets to the moon, is
> thus harnessed to the emotional capacity of a crocodile and a horse
> structured into the primitive parts of our brain. Prof. P.D. Maclean
> contributed many research papers on what he called this
> schizophysiology, a built in split between emotion and intellect that
> accounts for the human social dilemma.
>
> The medial surface of the right hemisphere is shown, along with the
> secondary motor area, so that these areas of both hemispheres face one
> another across the central fissure. This allows one side to act as a
> referent for the other side in the bilateral integration of movement.
> The brain stem and cerebellum are omitted. The primary motor and
> sensory areas are shown on the top surface of the neocortex. The
> secondary sensory areas are on the outer sides of the cortex.
>
> The neocortical hemispheres are extensively interconnected by the
> corpus callosum, a huge nerve bundle. The fornix projects from the
> archicortex to the hypothalamus, and some fibers cross to the other
> side, thus constituting a limbic commissure, interconnecting the
> limbic hemispheres, as do the posterior and anterior commissures. The
> primitive limbic brain can thus function independently of the
> neocortical (new) brain.

> THE HYPOTHALAMUS & CEREBELLUM
>
> The hypothalamus receives major inputs from the limbic system via
> several routes, including the fornix. It also projects back to the
> limbic cortex, maintaining two-way communication. The hypothalamus
> integrates visceral sensory information from the body's internal
> organs. Descending projections from the hypothalamus are relayed via
> descending tracts activating autonomic functions and also directly
> influencing somatic activity. Direct connection to the pituitary gland
> complements autonomic activation of the endocrine glands. The
> hypothalamus is thus centrally concerned with both the feedback of
> emotional input to thought processes and also with emotional
> expression via the autonomic nervous system to fuel the body's
> actions.
>
> The cerebellum and brain stem are shown sectioned through their
> midline. The cerebellum receives dense inputs from the proprioceptive
> nervous system together with the motor and sensory areas of the
> neocortex, with widespread input from other areas of the central
> nervous system including all sensory systems. The cerebellum projects
> to the vestibular system concerned with balance and also to the motor
> systems by various routes, including both direct and indirect
> projections to the motor areas of the neocortex and to the motor horns
> of the spinal column. Other motor projections go to both descending
> reticulo-spinal tracts, one somatic and one autonomic. Since these

1.  Planck's constant, the universal quantum of action, clearly points
    to two alternate modes for what we perceive as the material content
    of the universe. The one mode is fixed as particulate matter and is
    specifically determined in spatially complete form. The alternate
    mode, although quantized as bundles of energy that correspond to
    particulate matter, is non-specific and cannot be spatially
    identified. This strongly implies that the material content of the
    universe is in fact involved in a very rapid and universally
    synchronous oscillation between the two modes. One mode is spatially
    complete, the other mode spatially indeterminate, such that events
    are prescribed by sequential frames in a holographic movie of cosmic
    proportions. The spatially complete frames may be called *space
    frames*. The spatially indeterminate frames may be called *quantum
    frames*. The latter are void of form.

2.  What we know as the wave character of matter is associated with the
    synchronous oscillation back and forth between the two modes. This
    means that the entire universe is vanishing and recurring very
    rapidly with and before our eyes, the continuity of events being
    provided by quantum jumps in position from one space frame to the
    next, through the agency of the intermediate quantum frames. This is
    analogous to an ordinary movie where the blank screen facilitates
    the projection of successive frames to lend the illusion of
    continuous action. The blank screen in this case is the spatially
    indeterminate quantum frames. They allow an ever changing
    assimilation and configuration of particulate matter in a series of
    space frames. There is thus a dynamic identity between spatial form
    and quantized energy as non-specific emptiness, the latter acting as
    a *master sensorium* or repository of experience between space
    frames. Because experience is in reflux and renewal, the sensorium
    also spans history and regulates dissynchronous elements.

         height="0.18701334208223971in"}The quantization of the
         electromagnetic spectrum, as it projects through space, is a
         universal measure of this fundamental oscillating action, hence
         Planck's relation E=h . The quantization of energy, E, is a
         function of the frequency, , because the universal action, h,
         is synchronous for all frequencies. The electromagnetic
         spectrum is being interrupted across its entire breadth by the
         successive disappearance and recurrence of space frames, thus
         requiring light to project as a series of pulses.

     2.  The speed of light, as measured in vacuum through space, is
         universally constant because the recurrence of space frames is
         universally synchronous irrespective of relative motions.
         Relative motions can be known only between relative positions
         in successive space frames. Light moves the same within each
         frame relative to the primary projection of each atom. It must
         close the space in each frame.

     3.  Time, as we are able to measure it as a linear phenomenon, is
         associated with the recurrence of space frames. We measure time
         by regular cyclic motions, such as the rotation of the earth,
         and these motions reflect a series of quantum jumps in position
         through successive space frames. Each successive frame thus
         specifies a universal primary interval of time. It is possible
         to measure the length of this interval in terms of classical
         units of time because each space frame recurs for a specific
         duration relative to the propagation of light. This primary
         interval is 1.52 x 10-16 seconds, the revolution period in the
         first electron orbit of hydrogen. It is also the time required
         for light to circumscribe the largest stable atom, since the
         atom must be spatially coherent within each space frame.

     4.  Although a common simultaneity for separate bodies, in relative
         motion through space, may not be established through direct
         measurements with clocks, as relativity theory maintains,1 we
         may nevertheless attach a universal significance to the concept
         of synchronicity. Since there is sound evidence to clearly
         indicate that matter is inherently intermittent, it in fact
         must be synchronous if we are to perceive the material
         surroundings with any degree of integrity at all. Although
         synchronous distortions may be introduced through relative
         motions that affect spatial perceptions and our ability to make
         measurements, this does not discredit the fact that a
         preponderance of synchronous events still prevail. Even in
         extreme cases where synchronous distortions may be so severe as
         to result in black holes, these can only manifest relative to a
         preponderance of synchronous events.

323. *Appendix 3*

     1.  Gravity is universally operative independent of transmission
         through space and time, since it is associated with a universal
         present in the synchronous projection of the movie. It is an
         expression of an underlying unity implicit in all particulate
         matter. The attractive force of gravity resides in the
         universal aspect common to diverse forms of matter separated in
         space, and it is effected through the quantum mode. The
         tendency to come together is an expression of the oneness of
         physical being, a oneness that is manifest in the spatially
         indeterminate quantum frame. In this respect the unity of the
         quantum frame is the inverse of the space frame where
         particulate matter is separate and distinct. (The universal law
         of gravitation can be derived from System 3, as can special
         relativity and other fundamental formulae of physics.)

     2.  Relative motions tend to distort the perception of space and
         time because light is unable to fully bridge the quantum jumps
         in position between successive synchronous frames, and yet the
         movie must cohere as a whole. In Newtonian physics this
         tendency manifests as a force required to accelerate one body
         with respect to another. This shows up as a discrepancy of
         units in the familiar relation F=ma. The units of force and
         mass are the same, leaving a discrepancy in distance per second
         per second. This is a discrepancy of change in position through
         successive frames. This distortion in the uniform perception of
         space and time is balanced by an external expenditure of energy
         as work. This is the inverse to the effect of gravity as an
         attractive force that functions from within. We shall see that
         gravity is one of a class of forces that function via the
         quantum mode. Also note the significance for general relativity
         that gravity is the inverse of acceleration, not its space-time
         equivalent as the theory assumes.

     3.  When relative velocities approach the speed of light a more
         severe kind of distortion becomes apparent because relative
         space frame sequences are perceived out of synchronization.
         There is a relative skipping of space frames balanced by a
         relative accumulation of quantum frames between different
         inertial systems, because light cannot otherwise bridge the
         jumps in position. The quantum sensorium spans the relative
         history. This shows up as the familiar relativistic
         discrepancies indicated by the Lorentz transformations of
         special relativity. There is still no sound reason to believe
         that these transformations "\...do away with the absolute
         character of the concept of simultaneity," as Einstein stated.2
         They merely account for synchronous distortions between
         inertial systems.

324. *Fisherman's Guide*

     1.  Space frames are skipped in the inertial system of the
         *observer* with respect to the moving body. This is balanced by
         a relative accumulation of quantum frames with respect to the
         observed body in motion. There is no compelling reason to
         suggest that the position of a so-called stationary observer is
         necessarily an arbitrary matter and that we must accordingly
         seek out mathematically covariant laws with respect to
         continuous transformations of space-time coordinates. This
         basic principle of general relativity doesn't take cognizance
         of the fact that experience is not presented to us in this way.
         Uniform patterns of cyclic motions dominate the heavens in a
         highly organized hierarchical manner, cascading down from
         galaxies to suns to planets and moons. When we speak of
         inertial systems as resisting acceleration, we must therefore
         see it within the context of the theater in which we are
         observing the movie. Acceleration is always relative to the
         preponderance of synchronous patterns of momentum that prevail,
         for it both conforms to and disturbs those established patterns
         as they exist hierarchically. A classic example is Foucault's
         pendulum, where the arc of its swings rotate to counter the
         earth's rotation. The pendulum may be set in its swings by the
         gravitational pull of the earth, but the direction of its
         swings is synchronous with the position of the galaxy at large.

     2.  ![](images/cosmordall/media/image183.png){width="0.16772200349956257in"
         height="0.18701334208223971in"}Momentum is a quantization of
         uniform relative motion. This is inferred by de Broglie's wave
         equation, where the quantum of action, h, is equivalent to the
         product of the relativistic momentum of a particle, p, and its
         wave length, . If the wave motion of matter is a result of the
         oscillation between quantum and space frames, then it follows
         that the wave length assigned to a particle should be
         associated with the quantum jumps in position from one space
         frame to the next, relative to its perceived place in the
         projection of the movie. A curious paradox arises at this
         point, because one would expect the wavelength to increase with
         the momentum, an increase in velocity representing an increase
         in wavelength from frame to frame. In fact the opposite must be
         true, because the product of the momentum and wavelength is
         equivalent to the universal constant, h. There is again a
         dimensional discrepancy of unit distance per second per second,
         which indicates that the paradox is associated with a
         synchronous distortion between the observer and the particle.
         If the uniform motion of the particle is offset by a relative
         skipping of *observer* space frames, the paradox is resolved,
         because the observer is also a collection of quantized momentum
         in the movie production, moving with the earth in its orbs
         within orbs. A relative skipping of observer space frames thus
         has the effect of increasing the apparent frequency of particle

1.  Uniform velocities may be considered inertial because particulate
    masses are independently assimilated in the movie. The duration of
    each space frame is sufficient to allow light to circumscribe any
    typical atom, but not larger conglomerates of atoms as molecules in
    concentrations of matter. The latter are assimilated through atomic
    characteristics that allow them to mutually relate collectively
    through interfaces of interaction. Within each space frame, however,
    activity is restricted to electromagnetic phenomena. The uniform
    motion of an atom, or a unified collection of atoms, is a quantized
    event, occurring from one space frame to the next, along with the
    preponderance of other synchronous events. If there is no change in
    the degree of synchronous relationships from space frame to space
    frame, then no forces are introduced associated with further
    synchronous distortions. Velocity, or the relative lack of it, is
    therefore inertial so long as the relative shifts in position from
    space frame to space frame are uniform. It should be noted here that
    this requires another kind of time that is distinct from linear time
    as defined above in point

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
5.  There is a kind of duration that spans successive space frames to
    historically integrate the synchronization of events.3 This
    underlying, or rather transcendent, duration is associated with the
    quantum mode, and has been referred to as the *quantum sensorium*.
    For instance, there is a relative accumulation of quantized energy
    associated with moving particles to balance the relative skipping of
    observer space frames. This is essentially a quantization of
    experience that does not actualize to the observer in spatially
    explicit form, although it remains associated with the moving
    particle as an increase in its relativistic mass, a physical
    contraction in the direction of motion, and a dilation of time. (the
    Lorentz transformations.)

    1.  Since a complete atom is a closed and spatially distinct entity,
        being circumscribed by electromagnetic energy, the intimate
        relationship of photon to electron and proton therein is a
        closed electrically neutral relationship. Each of the three
        members of the triad were not mysteriously created as separate
        entities, as big bang theory maintains, electrons and protons
        just happening to balance out in equal numbers. If, however, an
        electron becomes excited beyond the electromagnetic limits for
        an atom, then light is unable to bridge the distance within one
        space frame. It must span two or more space frames to close the
        relationship between electron and proton, and it is this
        spanning of space frames by light that gives rise

1.  In the organization of moons, planets, suns and galaxies, there is a
    wide variety of phenomena that necessarily follow according to the
    above scenario, some of them well known. For example we know that
    somehow, since the consolidation of our solar system, that about 98%
    of the angular momentum has come to reside in the planets, even
    though 99% of the total mass resides in the sun. The rotational
    motion of the solar system introduces synchronous distortions with
    respect to the galaxy that are associated with angular velocity,
    although the mass of the solar system must be generally synchronous
    with the galaxy at large. This angular tendency to synchronous
    distortions manifests as a relative skipping of space frames in the
    center of the sun with respect to its own periphery and the
    peripheral planets. There is a corresponding accumulation of
    quantized momentum associated with the planets that cannot
    actualize, and yet it must manifest itself in some way, if it is not
    to build to unlimited extremes. Since we observe a differential
    rotation between the center of the sun and its periphery, it is
    reasonable to conclude that the accumulated momentum becomes
    translated as a force of retardation operative at the center of the
    sun. (The poles rotate in 33 days, the equator in 25 days, the
    inverse of what classical mechanics would predict.) This force is
    not transmitted externally through space, but rather internally via
    the quantum mode, as an internal winding down to preserve
    synchronicity. It is a force hitherto unidentified, and one of a
    possible variety of quantum forces operative on a cosmic scale.

2.  The differential rotation of the sun accounts for the spiral
    wrapping of the sun's electromagnetic field around its girth, a
    portion of the field being swept out with the solar wind into the
    planetary disc and beyond. The great electromagnetic arches that pop
    out from the sun's surface, associated with sun spots and solar
    flares, appear as direct evidence of an electromagnetic bridging of
    discrepancies in angular synchronicity within the sun.4 The sun's
    magnetic pole reversals, that occur approximately every eleven
    years, are also essential to balance synchronous distortions that
    would otherwise accumulate to unmanageable proportions. The earth's
    pole reversals are much less frequent, for synchronous problems have
    a different focus.

3.  When we turn our attention to the galaxy, we find that the focus
    shifts to the regulation of its material content, as distinct from
    the angular distortions within solar systems. The material content
    of the entire galaxy

1.  Because galaxies must be preponderantly synchronous, quantum forces
    may come into play in a variety of ways. Tendencies to angular
    synchronous distortions in solar systems, place them in instant
    communication with the galactic center, for the same singular
    condition exists at their respective centers via the quantum mode.
    The super abundance of accumulated momentum associated with the
    galaxy can thus be translated back to its stellar population as a
    regulatory force governing stellar migrations within the revolving
    disc. The entire stellar population of the galaxy becomes
    tensionally coupled within. It becomes one coherent whole. Stars
    must behave themselves within moderate limits and cannot go racing
    off without restraint at the beck and call of gravity, disturbing
    the synchronous integrity of the whole. Tendencies to excessive
    motions find a ready resistance. The apparent deficiencies in
    gravitational mass in current theories about galactic organization
    thus find new avenues of explanation that apply to many other
    phenomena as well.

2.  There is a growing body of evidence to indicate that there is reflux
    of the material content of a galaxy though the galactic center. In
    this scenario, old stars tend to migrate toward the center, where
    they are drawn into an accretion disc and torn apart as they spiral
    in toward an apparent black hole. Then there are intermittent
    massive ejections of material from the center, with star formation
    apparent as it migrates out toward the peripheral disc.5 As more
    data becomes available it should consolidate into a picture of
    eternal stellar regeneration.6 In a synchronous universe, galaxies
    function as cells of creative reflux and efflux, the heavy elements,
    created through stellar processes, being recycled back into hydrogen
    in the galactic core (where they encounter the synchronous

1.  When we look through our largest telescopes at the distant quasars,
    some of them emitting more energy than a thousand galaxies like our
    own, from a core only a light year or so in diameter, what are we
    seeing? When we see them oscillate with bursts of energy equivalent
    to the creation of many millions of suns over a period days, even
    hours or seconds, what are we seeing?7 The light from a galaxy a few
    billion light years distant can be older than our solar system by
    the time it reaches us. We have circumscribed our galaxy a couple of
    dozen times, and the distant galaxies may be turning somewhat slower
    or faster, the rate of stellar reflux being adjusted accordingly.
    Yet we share the same synchronous present with that galaxy as it
    exists today, and somehow, in the projection of the cosmic movie,
    light must bridge the intervening discrepancies in linear time, to
    integrate the history. A number of effects are to be expected. For
    instance synchronous discrepancies alone can red shift the light
    that we see, and this is not necessarily associated with recessional
    velocity at all. It may only be associated with great distance and
    the associated burden of historic integration reflected in the
    distortion of the light that we see. Synchronous discrepancies
    accumulated over such a time can also greatly accelerate the
    apparent relative frequency of distant events, similar to de
    Broglie's moving particles but on a grand scale. Synchronous
    distortions may introduce intermittent compensations in the way that
    we perceive them, like a periodic relief valve, creating an illusion
    of intense emissions and violent eruptions as observed in quasars
    and BL Lacs, where none existed in reality. Such phenomena might be
    expected as observational homologues to real ejections of matter
    from galactic centers. There is no compelling reason to suggest that
    we are looking back in time toward the original creation of the
    entire universe. In view of the above, there are more compelling
    reasons to suggest that the universe never had an origin, that the
    creative process transcends events in linear time, that it is both
    eternal and intelligently organized via the quantum sensorium. The
    void is the big screen in the cosmic movie.

2.  The background microwave radiation is there, of course, and real.
    But is it really a remnant of the separation of matter and radiation
    during the early epochs of a supposed big bang? Given the current
    state of our understanding, there may easily be other explanations.
    This single wisp of evidence is hardly sufficient to support the
    theory in the face of

1.  A synchronous universe introduces limitations in the application of
    mathematical methods currently available, because the properties of
    space and time, as we measure them, are not continuous. There is
    thus a minimum limit to the increment of the differential in the
    calculus that becomes very significant in quantum events. The
    uncertainty principle is related. The relative position of a moving
    particle can only be known

i.  We are concerned with the historic integration of the whole of
    experience and thus with the relationship of parts to the whole. We
    must allow for all possible variants of experience.

ii. There is an all pervasive dynamic interdependence between universal
    and particular aspects of experience that is fundamental to
    understanding the nature of phenomena of every kind. This is
    intimately associated with alternate modes in the cosmic projection
    of experience.

iii. The integration of experience displays hierarchical elements
     associated with degrees of universality subsumed in levels, as in
     the synchronous relationship of galaxies to suns to planets and
     moons. These hierarchies, as they are spatially perceived, are
     specific manifestations of a transcendent universal order.

> **FOREWORD**
>
> When Charles Darwin published his famous book *The Origin of Species*
> in 1859, he began a debate that has, if anything, gained in intensity
> over the years. With modern techniques of probing genes the debate has
> taken on new proportions. A new breed of biologist, armed with a
> genetic arsenal, is striving to reduce the whole of life to the
> mindless perpetuation of DNA sequences. This, some feel, is consistent
> with the cosmological implications of the Big Bang---the origin and
> evolution of the universe according to blind, deterministic laws. In
> its passion for unity, science reduces life to a meaningless
> enterprise, an accident without pattern, plan or purpose. What a grand
> vision to lend humanity a sense of cohesion and lead us into the new
> millennium inspired with hope and direction.
>
> On close examination, it becomes clearly apparent that there is no
> hard evidence to support random mutation and natural selection as the
> sole mechanism driving the evolution of species. This claim for a
> mindless evolutionary process, is itself a blind belief, completely
> lacking in substance. While many of us may sympathize with Darwin's
> disenchantment with the Biblical story of creation, this doesn't
> justify an alternate extreme. In the context of his time one can
> understand Darwin's need to reinterpret his evidence in a new, more
> coherent, and intelligent way. So he came up with the idea of
> accidental mutations which may, in rare cases, endow a greater
> survival advantage, leading to their natural selection, and
> consequently to the emergence and adaptation of new species according
> to environmental pressures.
>
> There is abundant evidence to indicate that life has evolved up
> through the lower species, and adaptation according to natural
> selection is surely a part of it. But there is also abundant evidence
> to indicate that there is intelligent direction implicit in the
> evolutionary process, unfortunately all of it overlooked by science.
> Such questions are forbidden in the halls of science. It seems that
> mainstream science insists on placing itself in opposition to anything
> remotely smacking of spiritual overtones. And yet science openly
> strives to close the book on the whole
>
> iii
>
> story of creation, to create a belief system with itself as the only
> authority, a book it believes must ultimately be accepted by all
> people for all time. It is an ambitious dream to be sure. But it would
> deny us any spiritual reality, deny there is any transcending basis to
> values, deny there are any moral issues implicit in experience, and
> consign us all to ultimate oblivion. This rather leaves us socially
> bankrupt as well. It's a truly strange phenomenon that well
> intentioned scientists of our intellectual elite could unwittingly
> embark on such a course. To any impartial observer something is off
> the rails. We are destroying ourselves through dogma, either the dogma
> of science or that of religion, and there doesn't appear to be any way
> to turn.
>
> With these thoughts in mind the following book is written in two
> parts. Part 1 is a critical review of the most outspoken hard line
> Darwinist's thinking, as expressed in one of his several popular books
> (Not required reading). Richard Dawkins, an Oxford professor, is a
> very high profile figure in the UK academic community who has done a
> great deal to popularize the Darwinian view. His confrontational
> approach begs analysis and it seems appropriate to single out one of
> his books for discussion. His approach invites a critical review of
> the arguments he presents.
>
> But it is not enough to ferret out the countless flaws in the thinking
> that pervades the whole of evolutionary biology. One must offer a more
> credible alternative consistent with the evidence. It is to this end
> that Part 2 is devoted to *An Intelligent Face for Evolution.*

> In the academic world it is usual for scientific contributions to be
> assessed by a peer review process that for all of its weaknesses is
> better than nothing. A peer review process can cut both ways, however.
> Biases inevitably come to play, as they do in all human endeavors, and
> a peer review process can often serve as much to promote them as to
> expose them. It is only over time, sometimes over periods of many
> centuries, that biases gradually get weeded out from our garden of
> acceptable ideas. In our current social environment, still on the
> threshold of the twentieth-first century, there is a tendency for
> certain academic ideas to get publicly extolled in popular editions,
> asserting views as established truth without confirming evidence to
> support them. This is a little disconcerting, since lay people have
> been educated to believe that science is a highly disciplined search
> for truth, based upon solid empirical evidence. We have seen the
> results. We drive cars. We have television sets and computers. It may
> therefore come as a surprise to some of us that strong biases and
> political pressures often prevail in
>
> scientific circles.
>
> In Part One of the book we will be examining scientific biases that
> are currently favored in evolution theory. Richard Dawkins is to be
> commended for his popular writing in this regard, for he has attempted
> to publicly address many questions posed by skeptics of the
> evolutionary process as viewed by Darwinists. In doing so he has
> opened the way for public examination of the issues involved, for they
> concern us all. Darwinism is taught in our schools and it inevitably
> influences the thinking of future generations and the direction that
> our cultures will take.
>
> Since literary works of a popular kind sometimes use the mantle of
> science to cloak biased views in the guise of truth, it is important
> that they be critically assessed. The scientists that write them have
> no conscious intention to deceive the public. They believe in the
> social value of what they are doing and they are conscientiously
> committed to their jobs. That's why they write. However subtle their
> biases may be they also wish to swing the tide of public opinion
> behind them. Science must sell itself as a worthy endeavor, as it
> should. We cannot get along without science.

> The public, of course, is usually in no position to assess the merits

> there is a good chance that many will believe the views that an expert
> expresses. In the interests of a little balance it should therefore be
> permissible for someone to take an academic writer to task over ideas
> that he publicly champions as truth.
>
> I don't mean to single out Richard Dawkins for personal criticism. I'm
> sure he is a conscientious man who is very committed to doing his job
> well. He also shows signs of being inconsistent with some of the
> extreme views he expresses in his book "*River out of Eden.*" And he
> may well have moderated his views since the book was first published
> in 1995. The book is nevertheless instructive because of the ideas it
> promotes that warrant the most critical examination. As one of the
> most vocal proponents of views that have become firmly entrenched in

> Richard Dawkins is the author of a number of popular books including
> *The Blind Watchmaker* and *The Selfish Gene*, books that by their

> of rare random mutations, a few of which accidentally endow a survival
> advantage that environmental selection pressures consequently favor.
> Some Darwinists have taken a more moderate line in recent decades, but

> Fungi will be considered as an involutionary variant of early plants

> that extract the energy they need. They provide a vital function in
> this involutionary process of decay. Most fungi are thus benign
> saprotrophs utilizing the waste of evolutionary variants, but some are
> parasites on living plants and animals.
>
> The algae, in parallel with the fungi, explored the eukaryotic format,
> predominantly in the sea and fresh water lakes and streams. Small
> simple forms first began to pioneer on land about five hundred million
> years ago. The simplest unicellular forms of algae reproduce by cell
> division with more complex forms developing alternate sexual and
> asexual generations, called the gametophyte and the sporophyte Both
> sexual and asexual reproduction of some kind generally occurs in
> algae.
>
> The reproductive processes of fungi are considerably more varied,
> especially since the mycellium or body of many fungi is not
> partitioned into separate cells, but consists of branching hyphae, or
> filaments. These filaments grow at their tips, like a maze of
> intertwined tributaries, to form the body of the fungus. The cytoplasm

4.  Experience is quantized into discrete episodes that become
    structurally integrated as elements of memory in the quantum
    sensorium, the Void. Quantized elements are recalled to form in the
    oscillating dance between particulate form and quantized emptiness
    that makes up the cosmic movie. The biosphere is a living whole that
    seeks balance and equilibrium between the myriad living organisms on
    every level that make up the sphere of life that surrounds the
    planet. It seeks resonance and harmony with itself in its
    oscillating dance, as surely as beating a drum head or strumming a
    string on a banjo. Experience explored in one part of the biosphere
    does not exist in isolation, even though it may be geographically
    isolated. It is integrated with and accessible to experience in
    other parts of the biosphere through biospheric resonance. There are
    countless instances of evolutionary copying between unrelated
    species, wherever they can exploit a complementary niche in the
    biosphere. Simply calling this convergent evolution on the blind
    assumption that it happens by an incredible series of fortuitous
    accidents explains nothing.

5.  Established behavioral patterns become quantized elements of
    technique and are preserved as elements of memory in the sensorium
    or Void. They are accessible through the structured relationship of
    the individual to the species, genus, order, class, etc., to the
    extent that taxonomy reflects the evolutionary order. They are also
    accessible between different lineages where resonance renders this
    feasible.

> **Concluding Comments:**
>
> This completes our excursion through the universal hierarchy of the
> evolutionary order on the planet. The hierarchy itself gives us many
> clues as to the modus operandi of the creative process, especially
> when we draw parallels to the structuring of a business enterprise.
> The fact that this pattern is there in any creative process is itself
> compelling evidence of intelligence at work in the evolutionary
> process, just as it is at work in the organization and integration of
> experience generally. On whatever scale we may choose to examine
> living processes, similar hierarchies can be identified. This can
> hardly be the result of blind chance.
>
> We have not undertaken to explore the terms, transformations, and
> symmetries of the System here, but they are very revealing. The author
> has thoroughly explored the first four *Systems* in books listed in
> the endnotes below. The complete delineation of the System, as it
> relates to
>
> 155
>
> the biological evolution of life on the planet, is an enormous chore.
> It can nevertheless meaningfully assimilate the accumulated factual
> knowledge of the biological sciences and give them coherent direction.
> The missing piece in our scientific endeavors has been the question of
> how experience itself is organized. The *System* can provide this
> missing link by offering intelligent insight into the cosmic order.
>
> Perhaps the most remarkable thing about the cosmic order is that it
> can evolve sentient beings capable of knowing itself distinct from
> itself as a supremely intelligent *System* integrating the whole of
> experience on a universal scale. It is the universal basis of being.
> Everything in the universe is interrelated and interdependent in a
> bewildering maze of interactions, yet a conscious mind can rise
> through the ranks of biological evolution to transcend its own roots
> in the universe. By knowing the System as the intelligent pattern of
> being from which all creation derives, one can transcend with the
> System the whole of creation, the whole of space and time, the whole
> of history, in a way that defies definition or analysis. This eternal
> realization is the basis of all values, all truth, all goodness, all

> THE LIMBIC CORTEX

> The Limbic cortex consists of the archicortex, shown in dark gray, and

> around the inside medial surface of the newer neocortex. They are
> directly connected to the autonomic nervous system and emotion via the
> hypothalamus. The neocortex, to which we owe our intellectual
> capacity, has no direct controls over emotion. Our creative intellect,

> contributed many research papers on what he called this
> schizophysiology, a built in split between emotion and intellect that
> accounts for the human social dilemma.

> The medial surface of the right hemisphere is shown, along with the
> secondary motor area, so that these areas of both hemispheres face one
> another across the central fissure. This allows one side to act as a
> referent for the other side in the bilateral integration of movement.
> The brain stem and cerebellum are omitted. The primary motor and
> sensory areas are shown on the top surface of the neocortex. The
> secondary sensory areas are on the outer sides of the cortex.
>
> The neocortical hemispheres are extensively interconnected by the
> corpus callosum, a huge nerve bundle. The fornix projects from the

> THE HYPOTHALAMUS & CEREBELLUM
>
> The hypothalamus receives major inputs from the limbic system via
> several routes, including the fornix. It also projects back to the
> limbic cortex, maintaining two-way communication. The hypothalamus
> integrates visceral sensory information from the body's internal
> organs. Descending projections from the hypothalamus are relayed via
> descending tracts activating autonomic functions and also directly
> influencing somatic activity. Direct connection to the pituitary gland
> complements autonomic activation of the endocrine glands. The
> hypothalamus is thus centrally concerned with both the feedback of
> emotional input to thought processes and also with emotional
> expression via the autonomic nervous system to fuel the body's
> actions.
>
> The cerebellum and brain stem are shown sectioned through their
> midline. The cerebellum receives dense inputs from the proprioceptive
> nervous system together with the motor and sensory areas of the
> neocortex, with widespread input from other areas of the central
> nervous system including all sensory systems. The cerebellum projects
> to the vestibular system concerned with balance and also to the motor
> systems by various routes, including both direct and indirect
> projections to the motor areas of the neocortex and to the motor horns
> of the spinal column. Other motor projections go to both descending
> reticulo-spinal tracts, one somatic and one autonomic. Since these
> tracts are multi-synaptic they allow for the integration of patterned
> activity at different spinal levels. The cerebellum is thus situated
> to assist a balance between the three focal points of mentation in
> their self-similar somatic enactment, parallel to the emotional
> balance.

> **Foreword**
>
> The following is a descriptive account of how the Supreme Being
> appeared directly in front of the author and explicitly demonstrated
> the workings of the cosmic order. This initial experience was preceded
> by five days of continual organic ecstasy, which ended with a vision
> of the Human Archetype followed by the awesome experience of the Void.
> The Void was explicitly shown to be the timeless and boundless empty
> side of all form. It embraces the whole history of creation without
> distinction between subject and object. Everything vanished! God then
> made His incredible appearance and explicitly employed the quantum
> energies of the Void as a medium of communication. As the master
> memory bank of creation the Void spans history. It is universally
> associated with mind. These revelations have profound implications for
> our personal spiritual destiny according to how we privately relate to
> others and the biosphere. In the public domain this concerns our
> physical, biological and social sciences with related implications for
> the world's spiritual traditions. No language was employed. The
> concepts were visually and experientially demonstrated in a way that
> could not be denied. The initial experience came nearly 48 years ago
> at age 32 in response to an intensive quest into organizations
> structure when I was a key management figure in a highly charged
> company takeover. The Supreme Being orchestrated more experiences to
> assist the difficult task of making rational sense of them in the
> years that followed.
>
> This work has aspects that are common to all of the world's spiritual
> traditions and that are also consistent with the empirical evidence of
> our sciences. It draws our spiritual and scientific beliefs into
> question in a way that can pry open the mind's eye to a more
> constructive view of the world we live in. It is a major paradigm
> shift that can open intuitive perceptions to far more meaningful
> horizons. It can help to resolve some of the global difficulties that
> are becoming ever more prevalent and likely to escalate. It offers a
> new avenue of hope. It cannot be a blind belief system since it must
> find direct confirmation in sensory experience in some way, in both
> the public and private domains. It can only be realized through a
> personal quest. The presentation should open new avenues of wonder for
> any reader whether or not they understand any of it in language.

>
> **Chapter Summary:**
>
> The first in a series of cosmic experiences was preceded by five days
> of Organic Union with the Archetype of Humanity subsuming all life in
> the biosphere. A vibrant harmony was experienced between an archetypal
> form to the body and the physical body. It lasted continuously in
> joyous union with the biosphere as a living whole. The energy
> processes within all things could be visually seen and sensed in
> immensely complex patterns of light playing through everything and
> knitting it into an integrated terrestrial Being behind mere physical
> appearances. Then after five days it turned around. I found myself
> face to face with the Suffering Face of Humanity. The ghost-like face
> of humanity embraced the whole of our tragic history all the way back
> to our distant evolutionary origins. This Archetype of Humanity is
> facing impending disastrous events. A telepathic message was rejected
> which placed the author outside the pale of humanity. As I walked to
> another room my feet were stopped in their tracks and all organic
> feedback to consciousness was totally suspended. The boundless Void
> was introduced as the empty side of all Form. Everything vanished.
> Succeeding chapters describe how the Supreme Being appeared and
> proceeded to employ the energies of the Void as a medium of
> communication transcending the whole of creation. He explicitly
> demonstrated visually and experientially how the cosmic order works
> and how it has profound implications for our personal spiritual
> destiny. It also revealed a new methodology with specific pragmatic
> application to the physical, biological and social sciences consistent
> with the empirical evidence as described in succeeding chapters.

> **General Comment:**
>
> The following descriptions of unusual organic and cosmic experiences
> are offered to explain the source of my work in other books and
> articles freely available on my website.\* I am simply being honest
> about how these ideas originated. I do not believe it is possible for
> anyone to re-invent the whole cosmic order by personal efforts. Indeed
> the collective intelligence of countless brilliant scientists has
> failed at the endeavour despite the many contributions of modern
> science. It follows that the essential core ideas of this work are not
> an intellectual contrivance of mine. I can take no personal credit for
> them. They were explictly demonstrated to me visually and
> experientially without language in a way that has taken a lifetime to
> properly understand. It explicitly showed that our personal
> commitments can have eternal value that concerns our spiritual
> destiny. Also demonstrated is a universal methodolgy that can
> complement traditional approaches to the sciences and expand their
> horizons in far more meaningful ways. Despite the profoundly spiritual
> nature of the revelations they did not focus on traditional religions.
> It is a mistake to interpret this work in the context of any specific
> religion to the exclusion of others, just as it is a mistake to
> dismiss it as spiritual nonsense opposed to reason and science.

> **Introduction:**
>
> A revelatory experience, about how the cosmic order works, first came
> as a result of a prolonged intensive effort to understand the nature
> of a business organization. Although I grew up close to nature on a
> farm and fishing camp in a wilderness area of Northern Ontario I was
> not a religious or spiritual person in a traditional sense. I
> nevertheless had an abiding empathy with nature. My parents worked
> unusually hard and they wanted me to have a university education.
> After graduating from the University of Toronto as a Chemical Engineer
> in 1958 I first had a job as a Corrosion Engineer with a corrosion
> consulting company and I spent some time working in Calgary Alberta as
> well as in Ontario. On my return to Ontario from the West I accepted
> an offer to work with a natural gas utility company in the steel city
> of Hamilton and vicinity near Toronto. It was a rapidly growing area.
>
> Having acquired some limited experience, I was assigned sole
> responsibility for corrosion and leakage control in the company at the
> age of 22. They had no one and it was a drastic situation. At first I
> did not realize that the situation was dire. Natural gas had just
> arrived from western Canada and after conversion the fifty year old
> manufactured gas mains dried out. A house had just blown up killing
> two people. In fact most of the city was at serious risk. The leak
> count was infinite and most of them were unfixable. There were not
> even maps of where the buried gas mains were. The situation required
> the redesign and replacement of the entire pipeline distribution
> system through many hundreds of miles of city streets. Consequently my
> responsibilities expanded rapidly until I was responsible for
> directing the design, planning, construction, maintenance and general
> operation of the entire buried system. I just happened to be there and
> capable and the job fell to me, with indispensable input and support
> from a few old timers. It was a unique situation.
>
> The organization had also chaotically exploded many times in size over
> night. There was no order to it. I soon found myself directing the
> work of hundreds of gas company and contractor employees. Most of us
> were young and everyone pitched in to create the needed organization.
> New departments, new methods and communications had to be established.
> After a number of years working long hours a smooth running safe
> organization resulted. Then while approaching my late twenties I
> gradually found myself a key management figure in a political battle
> that
>

>
> ensued for several years. Following a highly charged company takeover
> that was finally consummated the political battle became very intense.
>
> The parent company although a much larger sprawling company lagged far
> behind us in safety and had serious organizational problems. They
> nevertheless wanted to centralize operations to the point where we
> would lose control over the safe operation of our much more
> concentrated franchise area with rapid population growth. Their staff
> organization of over 300 experts, at their new head office a couple
> hundred miles distant, had no line authority over me. I was expected
> to voluntarily agree with measure after measure that I knew would not
> work in our context, and counter suggestions were not accepted.
>
> Perhaps I should have simply resigned but many people were dependent
> on me. Many of us had put too much into the organization to just walk
> away and leave it to absentee experts who did not know what they were
> doing. They kept asking why, why, why. They could not grasp the
> interconnected complexity of the whole organization. Two vice
> presidents who wanted complete control were the core of the problem.
> The staff experts had to try and provide it for them. The president,
> although a nice man, was an accountant with no practical operating
> insight.
>
> I had human resources at my disposal and as the struggle became very
> intense, I undertook a detailed quantitative study of every formal and
> informal communication in the entire company, in an effort to show
> decisively that the system the new parent company wanted to impose
> would not work. It would not provide us with the communications we
> needed to function and it would leave us without direct access to
> essential records. We would even lose control of our mapping system
> and warehouse. It would reduce us all to drones following mindless
> directives from afar. It would throw us back into chaos, while many
> tens of thousands of pieces of paper would flow into their new marble
> head office.
>
> The study identified working groups and evaluated every task and
> communication between them that was essential to the integrated
> operation of the whole company. It was a quantitative study which
> required counting the number of work orders, feedback reports,
> drawings, cost estimates, phone calls, filing references, budgeting
> reports, administrative reports and so on. It was a very demanding
> task that took the task group assigned seven months to complete. I
> doubt it has ever been done in this kind of detail before or since. It
> required an intensive quest into the roots of organization structure.
> It was a quest into the roots of meaning, as I came to appreciate.
>
> During this period of intensive analysis, including self analysis, an
> intuitive insight gradually formulated itself that had implications
> far beyond the organization of a company. I was very taken by the
> dynamics and implications of this intuitive pattern to experience in
> general. It was a triadic pattern that included how we make
> commitments and account for behaviour in our personal lives as well.
> There are parallels to how a business works. It focused my attention
> in a new way and I began to see implications in the natural order of
> things. It excited me with possibilities that I had never considered
> before.
>
> About this time when I was finishing the report a friend who had
> worked for me prior and transferred to head office gave me a copy of
> an obscure journal with an article by John G. Bennett that talked
> about space, time, eternity and hyparxis in relation to physics.
> Although I

> didn't understand it I sensed a connection. There was also an article
> in the journal by Albert Low on organization structure that seemed to
> make sense. But what really gripped me was a possible connection
> between physics and business organization in the context of the mind.
> This was somehow related to that triadic pattern that excited me. It
> was not a linear cause and effect pattern. It was a recurring cyclic
> pattern of Means, Goal and Consequence that could integrate many
> diverse elements of phenomenal experience.
>
> I had just finished compiling the report which was condensed into a
> couple hundred pages of charts and tables. I had the full support of
> my boss. He was a remarkable manager who gave me a completely free
> hand. After it was finally submitted to head office I was exhausted
> and my mind was in a tumult, churning with new possibilities. I felt
> on the brink of something immense. And something immense is what
> happened.
>
> The workings of the whole cosmic order were explicitly revealed by a
> universal intelligence that demonstrated Himself to be the Supreme
> Being transcending and subsuming the whole of creation. A method of
> delineating the whole cosmic order was explicitly revealed visually
> and experientially without language. I call it simply The System. It
> consists of an open ended nested hierarchy of subsumed higher Systems
> that elaborate within itself. This cosmic revelations came after five

> **The Organic Union Experience**
>
> One evening a day or so after the company report was submitted I came
> home from work feeling drained. I had been at it long hours for many
> months. My thought processes had been turning like huge heavy wheels
> at the demands of intuitively grasping the integrated operation of the
> company as a whole while questioning how every detail fit with the
> whole. I was mentally and emotionally exhausted. I had done everything
> that I felt I could do and could only wait to see if there would
> eventually be some response to the report. I entered my apartment
> where I lived alone and immediately lay down on the sofa, my head on a
> cushion, my hands folded across my chest. My eyes fell closed.
>
> Almost at once the tension and turmoil of the preceding months fell
> away. I became aware of the inside of my head, what I thought was my
> own mind. I thought this kind of awareness unusual. Can one be aware
> of one's own mind? Then who is aware? My focus wandered like a kind of
> independent perception through my whole body. My attention fell to the

> than a pinprick. From it a little shower of lights trickled across my
> mind as I conceived of it inside my head. It was like a tiny fireworks
> display that I simply observed. It was odd but it didn't disturb me.
> My attention fell again to the rhythmic rise and fall of my breathing.
> A feeling of peace came over me.

> **Summary Observations about Organic Union:**
>
> During the first five days everything was bathed in living light:
> people, animals, plants, the air, everything, the whole biosphere. I
> was in union with an archetypal form to the form of my body. This is
> an essential point. I could feel the archetypal form of the cells and
> organs that make up
>
> 13
>
> my whole body distinct from the physical molecules of my body. The
> latter are shared with the interdependent molecular chemistry of the
> whole biosphere and its evolutionary history. It was apparent that the
> archetypal form I was in union with subsumed all life in the
> biosphere, including myself. The archetypal form was an integrated
> energy pattern that directed the organic chemistry of my body.
>
> In the process I was in joyous union with the immense complexity of
> living energy transformations within everything, making everything
> into what it is and knitting it all together in a vast ocean of living
> energy. It embraced all life on the planet as a living whole. İt was a
> living terrestrial Being embracing the biosphere. I functioned
> normally with complete sobriety and equanimity while bathed in the
> organic ecstasy that filled every fibre of my being every waking
> moment for five days.
>
> Then I was aware of this unbounded archetypal unity turning around. I
> could sense the form to the form of my body inverting. It perceptually
> transposed from subjective union within me on the *inside* to being
> separate from me objectively *outside* of me albeit intimately linked
> to me. This balance between a common Inside and a common Outside was
> to be demonstrated as of universal importance in the cosmic
> experiences that followed.
>
> There are only two possible orientations of two active interfaces
> which constitute what I call System 2. It is illustrated as Figure 2
> in Chapter 3. One orientation is called the Objective Orientation
> where the universal Human Archetype is Subjective to a Particular
> Human Being and thus subjectively in union with them as in the five
> days of ecstasy. I could Objectively see and feel that I was in union
> with the whole biosphere because I was Subjectively transcended. The
> meanings of the words begin to compound within themselves.
>
> In the Subjective Orientation I was visually looking objectively into
> the Human Archetype face to face because it had turned around to
> subjectively look at me. lt was the archetype or genotype of humanity.
> It was the suffering face of a ghost-like elderly man. One might well
> call it the Holy Ghost, whether that is consistent with the Holy Ghost
> in the Christian trinity or not. There were no explicit Biblical
> implications. The face was embedded in a transparent two-dimensional
> energy interface which was unbounded. It was open, without limit, in
> all directions which means that it encompasses and subsumes the
> organic and cultural evolution of humanity in the biosphere.
>
> This Suffering Face of Humanity was an archetypal energy interface
> with unlimited depth behind the two dimensional transparent interface.
> I was looking into the Void through it. I could read the history of
> humankind going back to our obscure human origins in our distant
> evolutionary past behind the interface as far as I could visually see.
> The depth of the immense suffering and the cataclysmic impending
> events that it may not survive implicitly involved the whole
> biosphere. I was sitting at the time. I was highly alert and very
> apprehensive. There was an undeniable link between us. I was a human
> being.
>
> The five days had started with another face to face encounter however.
> As the ecstatic harmony first began I saw a mirror image of my own
> face looking directly at me. I implicitly recognized this face as my
> genuine self looking intently and impartially at myself. It was
> accompanied by a
>
> 14
>
> deep sense of honesty and truth. It was my personal archetypal energy
> pattern. I was later to discover that there is an open two dimensional
> active interface associated with my Personal Archetype also. Every
> human being needs a personal archetype in order to integrate the
> diversity of their experience, although we are not always in close
> touch with it.
>
> This personal archetypal energy pattern regulates the body's specific
> organic processes as they relate to each human being's situation and
> circumstance. But when I became aware of a form to the form of my
> physical organic body and when a harmony between the two grew into a
> golden living light, I came into union with the human archetypal
> pattern common to all human beings. This allowed my personal archetype
> to turn around or perceptually transpose so that I could visually see
> and experience it. I experienced myself as within my body seeing my
> archetypal self apart from myself but nevertheless intimately
> connected with it. My organic body was subjectively sustained and
> transcended by the Human Archetype. I was subjectively taken over by
> it and yet I could function normally, albeit in a state of perpetual
> organic ecstasy until it turned around to look at me face to face.
>
> Union with the Human Archetype was a state of union and harmony with
> all living processes in the biosphere. This implicitly means that the
> human archetype subsumes all life in the biosphere from which we have
> evolved up through the ranks of our plant and animal ancestors. The
> archetypal energies of our ancestral species are hierarchically nested
> within the human archetype in this way. They have mothered us. They
> have explored and worked out capabilities and limitations over the
> whole course of biological evolution on the planet.
>
> Our evolutionary history has become vested in us in such a way as to

>
> **Chapter Summary:**
>
> Five days of organic ecstasy introduced a cosmic experience that was
> not organic in nature and that transcended the whole of creation via
> the timeless and boundless Void. The Void was demonstrated to be the
> empty side of Form experienced in awe and wonder without specific
> content. Everything vanished. The Supreme Being appeared directly in
> front of the author. God transcended and subsumed the Void and
> proceeded to employ its quantum energies to demonstrate the workings
> of the cosmic order after introducing Himself as the living
> manifestation of Universal Values. He explicitly demonstrated that
> there is No Truth and No Being apart from His Supreme Being. Although
> the experience was visually and experientially explicit the author was
> left without language to make rational sense of it. This lifelong task
> of interpreting it has resulted in a non-linguistic universal
> methodology than can complement the physical, biological and social
> sciences. The methodology, that I call simply the System, can expand
> the horizons of our understanding in far more meaningful ways that are
> fully consistent with the sensory evidence. How this relates to the
> awesome series of experiences, such as the Rift in Universal
> Wholeness, the recall of quantum memories from the Void, the opening
> of bottomless wells of access to facilitate the recall process is
> described. This led to a demonstration of how eternal contributions
> are being made towards a heavenly home in the making. Our personal
> spiritual destiny in all walks of life depends on how well we manage
> to bridge the rift between Self and Other than Self. Many bursts of
> insight followed into the sciences and how the whole cosmic order
> works. The author's mind was wrenched open beyond the limits of human
> endurance. It was very nearly fatal. More insights were orchestrated
> by the Supreme Being in the following years to assist in the lifelong
> process of making sense of the first one. These are described in
> succeeding chapters.

> **The Cosmic Experience:**
>
> Following five days of organic ecstasy I had just rejected a message
> from the Universal Human Archetype and unwittingly stepped outside
> humanity. I had walked into another room when my feet stopped in their
> tracks. Suddenly all organic feedback from my emotional apparatus to
> my cerebral mental processes was suspended. My slate was wiped clean
> in marked contrast to the living light that had filled me during the
> previous days. I had stepped outside of humanity even though I was
> still the same human being.
>
> I had a clear visual perception into an indeterminate formless
> distance that could be seen right through the walls of the room. The
> room lost its substantiality, becoming but a filmy transparent veneer
> over a vast and shining sea of mist. It was the boundless Void.
>
> A series of intuitive realizations came to me in an orderly sequence.
> They were intentionally fed to me from a source other than my personal
> being. I was aware that they came from another
>
> 17
>
> source that was different also from the tragic face of humanity.
> Organic feedback that normally fills one's mental processes ceased to
> function. The ecstasy that I had enjoyed through the previous days and
> that was organic in nature was gone. The intuitive perceptions that
> began to come were not organic in nature at all. They were cosmic.
>
> First there was a perception into the formless distance of unlimited
> possibilities. I intuitively recognized that possibilities need not be
> confined in any way, that their range is unlimited. I seemed able to
> see forever into the depths of the shining Void. This was followed by
> a few examples, most of which I cannot find words to describe. One of
> them was the possibility of unlimited lifespan. This brought with it a
> trace of anxiety about how to relate to an indefinite lifespan when
> our thoughts are so conditioned to a brief lifetime of striving ending
> in death. But even this latter concern was an intuitive one that was
> part of the series that was fed to me. My thoughts and emotions were
> being controlled. I was a passive observer to mental and emotional
> processes orchestrated by a source distinct from me.
>
> I took another step or two when the most disconcerting thing happened,
> though I didn't feel it so at the time. Everything vanished
> completely! The room, the city, the planet, the universe, even my own
> body, all just vanished completely! There was no loss of a sense of
> identity, despite not being identified with a body. I had no thoughts,
> no physical body, no perceptible body of any kind. I was an integral
> part of the vast and shining sea of mist that contained no forms
> whatsoever. It was an identity in emptiness with the whole of being.
> It was experienced with wonder, a pure sense of being and wonder.
> There was no organic rapture, no heavenly bliss, no pain, no loss, no
> gain, no sorrow. Everything was balanced in a field of pure being and
> wonder. It was like gazing into a silvery moonlit night without the
> moon or stars, even while being an integral part of the emptiness. It
> was a vast Void with a boundless quality of indeterminate depth.
>
> In a moment everything returned again as a thin transparent veneer,
> but only for a moment. Then everything was gone again. This happened
> several times in succession as if someone was switching the entire
> universe on and off to deliberately show me something. There was a
> reciprocal correspondence between the world of Form and the Void.
>
> Next that someone appeared in the room directly in front of me, about
> eight feet away. But He was not part of the world of material form, so
> that distance or magnitude had no real relevance. He was just suddenly
> there all at once. He was an awesomely indescribable and Supremely
> Intelligent Being. He was a being of pure living energy, but not a
> being of light. He was round but not spherical. He had depth within
> His Being but not as a physical spatial dimension. He was about two
> meters or so in diameter, both with form and without, both with color
> and without, constantly transforming within itself, yet staying the
> same.
>
> There were multitudinous tiers of intelligent transformations going on
> within Him, energies and colors transforming and changing in an
> infinite complexity of shifting patterns that were all meticulously
> integrated into the unspeakable dynamism of His Being. I could see
> into them even as they transformed and changed. He had a million eyes
> and ears, so to speak, a million living brains transmuting into one
> another, all of them interdependent with one another and with the
> whole of His Being. A million or a billion or a gillion, it is utterly
> impossible to describe. He was filled with a splendor and magnificence
> beyond all reproach. He was suddenly just hovering there
>
> 18
>
> immaculately ordered and harmonized unto Himself, seeing and knowing
> all, yet perfectly balanced and impartial.
>
> He could change His texture at will and communicate through emanations
> of energy that came like a shower of rain from every part of His
> Being. After His initial balanced appearance, He began to emanate
> friendliness toward me, just like meeting a new and genuine friend
> only much more so. There was no doubting the flawless quality of
> friendship He projected. He changed His texture again, this time to
> mercy. Unrestrained mercy came streaming from Him in an unqualified
> torrent of magnanimity. He changed again to compassion, unlimited
> compassion with the purest of heart. Then came an absolute deluge of
> infinite love with a warmth and depth exceeding anything that we know
> in human experience. Unblemished love came gushing freely from the
> bottomless wellspring of His entire being without the least
> expectation in return. There was not the slightest stain in the
> immaculate quality of His entire being.
>
> None of this came from me. Nothing of this was generated from within
> me or from within my physical body. It was not a product of my mind.
> It was infinitely beyond the powers of the wildest imagination. The
> Void was pure mind and it embraced the whole of existence. This
> Supreme Being transcended and subsumed the Void. He was the Master of
> the Void and the whole of experience. He was the living embodiment of
> Universal Values. He transcended the whole of space and time, the
> whole of the history of the entire universe. He had no origin in the
> universe. He was the living source of the universe as an eternal
> creation without beginning or end in space and time. He was God. He
> was Supreme above all. I could only share without words or language in
> this common realization between us transcending and subsuming
> creation.
>
> I stood there dumbfounded, gazing into the face of this incredible

> The description in Chapter 2 of how the Supreme Being explicitly
> demonstrated the workings of the cosmic order is assessed in more
> detail. Although the author was left without language to make rational
> sense of it, the lifelong task of interpreting it has resulted in a
> non-linguistic universal methodology than can complement the physical,
> biological and social sciences. The methodology, called simply the
> System, can expand the intuitive horizons of our understanding. A few
> illustrations are used to help to this end. Of central importance is
> the need to reconcile the Rift in Universal Wholeness between Self and
> Other than Self from which all creation derives. Our spiritual
> traditions and our sciences are provided with a common intuitive basis
> for close examination and review. All possible structural varieties of
> phenomenal experience are encompassed with respect to active interface
> processes between a Universal Inside and a Universal Outside, neither
> of which can be known to the exclusion of the other. It cannot be a
> theoretical belief system since it must find direct confirmation in
> phenomenal experience. The Rift in Wholeness between Self and Other is
> bridged through a creatively constructive commitment to living that
> has eternal value. In later chapters it will be shown that although we

> **The Void:**
>
> It is necessary to briefly review some descriptive passages relating
> to the Void to place important implications in context.
>
> After I rejected the message from the Suffering Face of Humanity I was
> stopped in my tracks. Everything was suddenly transparent. The room
> was a transparent veil over a vast empty boundlessness that was
> without specific content of any kind. I was aware that intuitive
> realizations were being fed to me by a transcendent intelligence
> distinct from the suffering human archetype. This Intelligent Being
> transcending me was in control of everything that followed.
>
> A few intuitive realizations were transmitted to me by the Supreme
> Being. I was aware that these insights were not of organic origin.
> They did not arise from within me. All my usual organic thought
> processes were totally suspended. There was a connection to my
> intuitive processes from Outside me that was governing profound
> intuitive realizations.
>
> Unlimited possibilities were implicit in my perception of the Void
> behind all physical form. This included the possibility of unlimited
> lifespan. It was implicitly apparent as the boundless duration of
> Being. In other words the Supreme Intelligence was intuitively
> informing me of the possibility of eternal life. The feeling of
> apprehension about how to relate to an endless lifespan impressed upon
> me that our actions are of critical importance in this regard.
>
> 30
>
> The boundlessness of the Void itself was implicitly timeless and
> spatially indeterminate. It was Void of all form. I could see forever
> through it behind the veil of form to the room that I was standing in.
> The silvery gray energies of the Void were orthogonal to the world of
> form. The Void is another timeless realm that spans and encompasses
> the whole of creation.
>
> Then everything vanished. The veil of form itself vanished. The room,
> the city, the universe, even my own body completely vanished. I was
> standing in a room and then it was gone! I was an integral part of the
> Void. There was no loss of identity but I was timelessly One with All
> that has ever been. There is no distinction between subject and object
> in the boundless Void. There were no perceptible boundaries to define
> separate things or events. This means it is also timeless. It is
> eternal because there is no distinction between internal and external.
>
> The Void is dimensionless being, an undifferentiated awareness
> experienced with pure awe and wonder. It is related to universal mind
> without specific content, yet timelessly embracing everything that has
> ever been. It spans and integrates history as a boundless field of
> perfectly balanced energy commitments to being. The Void is associated
> with mind without defining mind or consciousness or placing limits
> upon them. It is an awesome life changing experience in itself, but it
> cannot be properly interpreted without the experiences that followed.
>
> Then the veil of form returned again and then vanished again, several
> times in succession. I was aware that the Supreme Intelligence
> controlling everything was turning the entire universe on and off to
> explicitly demonstrate to me that the boundless and timeless energies
> of the Void were the empty side of the world of form. Forms are
> defined by specific boundaries that we see and sense. The Void is a
> reciprocal alternate side to the world that we see with physical Form.
> There is a dynamic balance maintained between them.
>
> The Void embraces the whole of history, not just the Forms of current
> phenomenal experience. It spans space and time. We see history
> directly when we look at a night sky. We see the stars as they were
> thousands and millions of years ago. Their light takes that long to
> reach us. As events unfolded they demonstrated how history is
> integrated.
>
> **The Void as a Master Memory Bank:**
>
> It is often overlooked that the objective physical world that we
> experience outside is really a subjective virtual reflection of the
> outside world reconstructed by our nervous system. Sensory input
> recreates the outside world from the unique perspective of each of us.
> Our sensory perceptions seek a balance between Inside and Outside that
> motivates our behavioural responses. In other words the integration of
> all experience is essentially subjective and spiritual in nature.
>
> The energies of the Void are spatially indeterminate. A specific
> location cannot be identified. Nothing can be identified. Nevertheless
> the quantum energies can be synchronously recalled into form as the
> fully coherent current physical world that we normally experience as
> sequential in space and time. This implicitly means that the Void is a
> timeless master sensorium or master memory bank which timelessly
> stores elements of experience for possible recall. We know in ordinary
> experience that we recall past events to make future commitments. We
> thus span and integrate events in space and time as they relate to
> each of us personally. The extent to which we have normal access to
> the Void makes this possible.
>
> 31
>
> This also means that diverse episodes of experience are mutually
> discrete. Physical events are packaged as quantum episodes of
> experience. The subjective and objective distinctions in each episode
> of experience are coalesced as one in distinct quantum bundles. They
> become separate sequences of action bundled as a unity according to
> how we make our commitments in response to the temporal flux of
> physical circumstance. For example jerky infant actions become
> integrated into fluent purposeful motions. Our first baby steps become
> smooth movement sequences in learning how to automatically walk. We
> walk to the store to buy groceries because we know certain supplies
> are running low. We integrate past and future by drawing on episodes
> of learned experience.
>
> This necessarily means that the physical universe is a discontinuous
> projection of sequential elements of experience synchronously recalled
> from the Void for each sequence. Since the Void is timeless it is
> orthogonal to the integrated fabric of space and time. In other words,
> the discrete sequential elements of form that are coherently recalled
> close ranks between discrete sequences, because the Void sequences
> between them are boundless and timeless. This provides the illusion of
> continuous space and time that we are so firmly conditioned to believe

> One circle alone could only suggest that all experience has a common

> When He rose from his place in System 2 relative to me to demonstrate

> **The Archetypal Jesus:**
>
> I had just finished this difficult task. For many months I had been
> living and reliving the earlier cosmic experiences that remained very
> much alive with me. They are still with me daily. My mind had been
> pried open and I had extraordinary access to profound levels of
> abstraction that were all embracing, especially during that period of
> intensive concentration. Those bottomless wells into the quantum
> energies of the Void and those bursts of knowing were related in ways
> I cannot describe. I knew what I was doing, but I couldn't say it in
> language. I nevertheless had gained a few limited words that provided
> me with a firm beginning.
>
> Just after I had finished this task I was sleeping one night on my
> right side. I was in a deep sleep. I was intentionally awakened by the
> Supreme Being in the middle of the night. I felt someone gently
> touching me on my shoulder. As I opened my eyes I could visually see a
> dark hand of energy reaching out of the Void to touch my shoulder and
> waken me. It moved ever so gently like a loving father waking a son.
> The intuitive impression and feeling of a loving father filled me.
>
> I rolled onto my back with my head raised slightly on the pillow. The
> silvery gray energies of Void were polarized with steely threads
> radiating everywhere from a small pitch black area that penetrated
> through the Void beyond where one corner of the room would be. It was
> past the invisible foot of the bed a little to my right. The veil of
> the room was there around the periphery in some manner. Everything was
> under His complete control including every cell in my body. The steely
> threads permeated me too. Everything was dead still.
>
> Although His presence was visually centered in the pitch black area I
> also felt His loving presence touch every point in my being. Every
> fiber of my being was filled with the one word "God". It is the only
> word that He ever explicitly conveyed to me. It was not a word I
> heard. It was not a voice in my head. The word undeniably permeated my
> whole being. I was filled with it in a loving way, like a father to a
> son. As usual I could have no personal thoughts, not even the thought
> that I could not. I could only share in His mind to the extent that He
> willed.
>
> Then at His Will the archetypal shape of the body of Jesus took form
> above where the ceiling would normally be, perhaps five meters above
> me, if distance has any meaning. It was a little to my left and above
> where the foot of the bed would have been. The veil of the form of the
> room was gone. The archetypal form of the body of Jesus was portrayed
> life size. It was not a three dimensional form. It was outlined around
> its edges in two dimensions by glowing light. I intuitively knew it
> was Jesus. His name didn't come as a word the way God identified
> Himself. I simply intuitively shared the knowledge with God of the
> identity of Jesus. They were not one and the same. The archetypal form
> of Jesus was distinct from God. Jesus was a terrestrial human. God is
> comic.
>
> Within the form outlined in glowing light I could both visually see
> and intuitively sense how the archetypal energies of Jesus are
> organized. There were complex silvery gray energy transformations
> going on within form of the body that were in immaculately balanced
> harmony with themselves and with the Will of God. I could visually see
> this and feel this. I intuitively knew this as I shared the
> realization with God. Then the archetypal form floated down into me
> like a leaf.
>
> 98
>
> It stopped in an alignment with the mid-coronal plane of my body which
> I knew was identified with my personal archetype. While aligned in
> that position within the transparent external form of my body there
> was a bright coalescence of light between my emotions in the general
> area of my heart and my left cerebral hemisphere, especially in the
> motor sensory areas. I could visually see it and feel it. I was still
> under God's loving control and I simply observed it. As it finished
> the archetypal form of Jesus passed on through me and disappeared back
> into the Void. I could visually see it pass through me as if I had
> total circumferential vision. It was a shared experience with God that
> was explicitly orchestrated by Him.
>
> It was over then. The room returned to normal. I was wide awake with
> heightened awareness throughout the experience. As it ended I was
> filled with a feeling of profound peace. I rolled over onto my left
> side and went blissfully back to sleep.
>
> It is a difficult thing to interpret. It did not seem to require

> I was still not religious in any traditional sense. I was not a church
> goer and I have nothing against those that are. We each have to find
> our own way. I do not have to listen to a sermon although I have
> nothing against doing so. I do not have to believe in God. I know God
> directly. This does not make me a superior human being. I am not a
> perfected human being. I still have shortcomings at times that I am
> well aware of. I am not a messiah. Even the historical Jesus was as
> common as clay. I was and am the same ordinary man. And this work
> could not be another belief system. The method of representing the
> cosmic order had to find direct confirmation in phenomenal experience
> in both the private and public domains.
>
> It was apparent however that the archetypal Jesus was harmoniously
> balanced with the cosmic order and with the Supreme Being. In other
> words the archetypal Jesus represents the evolutionary destiny of
> humanity in some sense if we are to survive as a civilization. There

> **A Related Event:**
>
> A couple of weeks later after awakening in bed one morning there was
> an event that was related to the experience of Jesus. It was very
> brief yet it made me wonder. Everything was transparent in the Void as
> usual and I was aware of His presence. Everything on the right side of

> side to the right of a mid sagittal plane that separates the left and
> right sides of the body. In other words it bisected the two
> dimensional mid coronal plane associated with my personal archetype.
> The entire right side flipped over 180 degrees. It turned over as if

> **Introduction:**
>
> Since I had to set about the task of finding better language for
> Systems 3 and 4 it meant rewriting everything I had done so far. I had
> to relate it to ordinary sensory experience as well as I could. This
> essentially meant writing a book that others could understand, or at
> least make it meaningful to a good extent in a way that would be
> readable. Despite my dislike of reading and writing this required more
> searching for direct sensory evidence of the System, not to mention
> learning how to write interesting prose. I was also faced with
> financial limitations; I was unemployed. Although I had the valuable
> basic concepts down on paper there was a huge job ahead. I still had
> some savings but I did not know how long the job ahead would take. I
> had to reduce my living costs. If I could avoid rent it would help a
> lot. I was then 39 but my concerns were focused on the importance of
> the writing task ahead and not on my professional or financial future.
> I lived in some unusual places and some additional unusual experiences
> came.
>
> **A New Venue for Writing:**
>
> My father had passed away ten years prior at age 77. My mother was in
> good health and living alone in a cottage on the lakefront of the
> original family homestead pioneered by my grandparents in 1876. It was
> a beautiful spot that had been my permanent home for 25 years as well,
> ever since part of the farm was sold and we moved there from the big
> farmhouse. I was
>
> 101
>
> quite close to both of my parents and my mother was very pleased when
> I returned in the spring to stay with her to do some writing.
>
> I had always kept a couple of boats and an outboard motor at the
> cottage. I had many tools in a small workshop and other possessions in
> a cottage bedroom that had been mine for a quarter of a century, so it
> was convenient to stay in the cottage with just food to buy for us.
> The cottage had a closed in porch which was a good place to write. It
> had a large window looking through some cedar trees to the lake. I
> could go fishing whenever I wanted which was also conducive to
> reflecting on the System. It thus occurred to me that short tales
> about fishing interspersed with technical parts about the System would
> make a book more readable. I could ground the ideas directly in
> sensory experience.
>
> I feel it is essential to offer a general overview of how the cosmic
> experiences that came to me matured into a universal methodology with
> practical applications. I simply do not know how else to convey some
> of the great difficulties that can be encountered to readers who may
> eventually take up the challenge to understand and apply this work.
> There is a veritable quicksand of tendencies for language to lead us
> astray, not to mention difficult social forces implicit in life
> circumstances that apply to each of us. In attempting to do this in a
> constructive way I would like to avoid a personal family situation
> that matured in a way that was beyond my control or that of my
> parents. Nevertheless touching on a few high points may be relevant to
> the overall message without getting into an autobiography of my family
> history. We are each born with burdens and blessings with the implied
> task of employing the blessings to redeem the burdens, whatever they
> may be.
>
> In any case when I returned to stay for an indefinite period on the
> family property problems arose with my brother who was thirteen years
> my elder and his wife. They had a place on a hill behind the cottage.
> As it happened when I was thirteen, my brother had convinced my father
> to change his will with himself as sole executor leaving him in
> complete control of mother's affairs. The cottage and property had
> been willed directly to me on the ruse of avoiding double inheritance
> tax, but held in trust by my brother as long as mother lived. My
> father had no way of knowing that there was no tax. He was a loving
> hard working man with a strong sense of justice. I did not suspect
> this either until it was too late.
>
> My brother had also tried to prevent both of my sisters from having
> homes contrary to our parent's heartfelt wishes. When I prevented that
> by freely giving valuable land belonging to me, to honour the spirit
> of my parent's will, the former good relations with my brother soured.
> There was a time when he could have gone either way. My parents had
> made great sacrifices to give him every chance in life. They did their
> very best for all four of us but their personal sacrifice was more for
> their eldest son, especially on the part of my father. Tragically, my
> brother drew on his blessings to add to his burdens. He sought
> supremacy of Self to the exclusion of Others.
>
> Nevertheless the long process of writing a book for publication had
> its tenuous beginnings. It seriously disturbed my brother that I
> should presume to write a book. I didn't really understand why it
> should at the time. My mother was now in her 80s and she knew that I
> had had some kind of a spiritual experience. She was a gentle good
> hearted woman who attended church and I didn't discuss the experience
> with her. Unfortunately my brother tried very hard to persuade her to
> his
>
> 102
>
> views about the matter. He openly believed that money is the measure
> of success. He had dispensed with my father's intended will and he
> sought complete control of our mother.
>
> I gave mother some of the fishing parts to read. She liked them and
> she was able to shrug off my brother's lectures. Like my father, who
> often suffered his oppressive manner, she would say that he doesn't
> really mean it. Both of them wanted to believe the best of their son
> and so did I. It was a strange family situation. The brother I had
> once regarded as a friend had become totally driven by greed. I kept
> my distance and focused on the task at hand. I was making some
> progress. It was pleasant staying with mother. Life was easier and the
> cosmic experiences stopped coming. I was making headway without them
> and they did not intrude. I already had the needed insights.
>
> **A Tragic Betrayal:**
>
> In the winter my parents had started staying in a mobile homes park in
> Sarasota Florida where a few local friends also had mobile homes
> permanently parked, and my mother still went. I had planned to add
> more insulation and heat to the cottage and stay the winter.
>
> One day when mother was out my brother burst into the cottage and
> claimed complete legal control of the cottage, that I had no rights
> there, demanding that I leave, that I had given my land away. He
> shouted the words at me. It was a shock.
>
> Without going into unpleasant details, at the moment he spoke I had a
> spontaneous vision in vivid colour. I saw an imposing man with moral
> authority over human actions sitting on an elevated throne in
> judgement. It came in a burst of light when my brother spoke. The man
> was unlike anyone I have ever seen. It was not like either the organic
> or the cosmic experiences. It was a specific human being with an
> ancestral quality. He projected uncompromising judgement. He was a
> daunting figure with an arresting presence. He had wavy white hair and
> beard and bushy white eyebrows. His hands were on the arms of the
> throne as his stern eyes surveyed the scene being enacted. There was
> no explicit indication that it was orchestrated by the Supreme Being.
> I don't know who he was. I don't know why but events in my life were
> seemingly being monitored. Maybe we all are. Nevertheless that visual
> burst of judgement influenced and moderated my response.
>
> It was a hateful thing for a brother to do. It upset mother terribly.
> She had no control of her own affairs. My brother insisted that her
> wish for me to have a deed to the cottage immediately could not be
> honoured because a will cannot be changed. By this time both of my
> sisters had homes on the lakefront properties. They wanted to avoid
> trouble and remained silent. Under the circumstances I had to leave.
> At least I had the pleasure of mother's company for the whole summer
> and I had made good headway on a book.
>
> **A Move to the Wilderness:**
>
> I moved to a cheap two room second story flat in Ville Marie, Quebec,
> for the winter. Ville Marie is a town of a few thousand predominantly
> French speaking people on Lake Temiskaming, the head waters of the
> Ottawa River. It is a three hour drive from Restoule. For a number of
> years I had flown in to fish many pristine lakes in the Kipawa
> district nearby with a couple of friends. I
>
> 103
>
> had discovered a logging road about a hundred miles northeast of Ville
> Marie that would provide me access to one of the lakes by car. I
> planned to get a boat and canoe into the lake the following spring and
> camp there on an island for the summer. I could collect more fishing
> stories and I also wanted to begin work on System 5.
>
> I continued all winter writing on the book about the cosmic order and
> the System. I also began writing a book on how it applied to the
> general organization of the human nervous system. There was a way to
> identify the mental and emotional polar relationships in experience
> that could help people to achieve a constructive balance between our
> three brains. I had been doing a lot of reading on the nervous system.
>
> In the spring I returned to Restoule to load a boat on a trailer, with
> gasoline, tents and camping supplies for the summer. The lake is 19
> miles long and relatively narrow. It was inhabited only by an
> Algonquin native couple that I knew from previous fishing trips. They
> had gone there on their honeymoon many years before and stayed.
>
> My mother was still very disturbed. I took a large tent and two
> smaller ones, some limited food supplies and I knew I could depend on
> good fishing for food. I knew of an ideal camping spot about ten miles
> down the lake from where I launched the boat. I parked the car and
> trailer in the bush and I had the tents pitched by nightfall. It was
> an interesting summer. One absorbs so much of nature living alone in
> the wilderness and becoming part of the neighborhood.
>
> When I left the lake three months later in the fall I returned
> everything to Restoule. I stayed with my mother a few days while
> packing personal belongings. She was still upset that I had to leave.
> My brother's commitment was total and would never change. He bragged
> to her how much money he was making for her in mortgages to make her
> feel obligated to him. At least she was still driving a car and she
> flew to Florida in the winter, where she had some relief. My parting
> with mother was difficult under the circumstances. My future access to
> her would be very limited.
>
> **Continuing the Work in Southern Ontario:**
>
> A lifelong friend who lived in an eastern suburb of Toronto owned a
> summer cottage near Bobcaygeon in the Kawartha Lakes district. He had
> already rewired it and installed some electric heating. He had also
> installed insulation between the studding. Since he had a thriving
> business in Toronto he had little time to finish the job. He offered
> to let me stay there for the winter to install knotty pine siding
> throughout the interior and finish the job he had started. The siding
> was stacked inside. It was free accommodation and I took him up on the
> offer.
>
> The cottage was only a foot above the level ground and it was not
> insulated underneath. I enclosed the space as well as I could with
> what was available and banked it with snow later. But it was cold. I
> had to wear skidoo boots with felt liners to avoid freezing my feet. I
> cut the fingertips out of a pair of gloves so I could handle tools and
> drive nails. I wore long underwear and a winter jacket inside. So my
> work on the System and writing was limited. It consisted mostly of
> reading and making scribbled notes.
>
> 104
>
> I moved to an old three story mansion a couple of blocks from the
> University of Toronto that had been converted into twenty-four small
> one room apartments. Mine was about ten feet by twelve feet or so with
> a pull out sofa bed, plus a small toilet and shower room at one end.
> There was a small refrigerator, an electric cooker and a sink with an
> overhead cupboard including a few dishes. It was nevertheless new and
> warm with double glazing in the window. There was parking space for my
> car behind the building. After a short period I was able to get
> reduced rent by acting as janitor, putting out garbage on certain
> days, vacuuming halls and collecting rent from the tenants. It didn't
> take a lot of time and I had access to the extensive library
> facilities at the University of Toronto. There were also book stores
> within walking distance so it suited my needs very well.
>
> I had soon completed a book on the System interspersed with tales
> about fishing and nature. I located a girl to type my books and I had
> started sending the first book off to publishers. In retrospect it was
> still very much premature. My writing had improved but not nearly
> enough. Nevertheless I mailed it off to many publishers in a variety
> of ways, mostly with a covering letter that was too lengthy and some
> sample chapters. Many publishers in those days accepted unsolicited
> submissions and they even replied. The personal computer had not yet
> arrived to swamp them with submissions from aspiring authors. The
> rejection notices were piling up.
>
> I was also making progress on the book on the nervous system. I had
> been doing a lot of reading on the nervous system for key information.
> I also found a few valuable reference books and the Toronto University
> libraries were a big help. I was collecting copies of key papers on
> physics as well.
>
> **Saved from an Angry Demonic Being:**
>
> The small table that I worked on was against the wall opposite the
> pull out sofa bed. About two more years had passed since I left
> Restoule permanently and I was in the process of putting the finishing
> touches on the nervous system book. I had just stood up from the table
> and was facing the wall when everything in front of my personal
> interface suddenly vanished without warning. I was gazing into the
> silvery gray energies of the Void.
>
> A demonic presence immediately appeared in front of me, a little to my
> left. The wall was not visible. It was a hellish looking being of
> living energy about a meter in diameter and a couple meters away. It
> was churning within itself with supreme rage about the work I was
> doing. The churning energies were disturbing shades of red and rose
> filled with hatred. It impressed me as an archetype of hatred that my
> brother had somehow invited and entertained. He shared the same
> hellish energy like a man possessed. It was not something to be
> trifled with.
>
> This demonic presence was building to a fever pitch of fuming wrath. I
> knew that this vile thing was about to smite me in some way I could
> not imagine. It wanted to destroy me. Many people certainly make
> degenerate commitments that are stored as memories in the Void. This
> monster seemed to be a living collection of them all. It could pass
> for the devil himself if there is one. I stood there not knowing what
> to do. I knew it was extremely dangerous.
>
> 105
>
> Suddenly I could visually see directly behind me while I was standing
> there facing the monstrous thing in the Void. I could see behind me as
> well as if I had eyes in the back of my head. From a point far behind

> two dimensional active interface. It stopped in an alignment with the
> transverse interface through my body that is associated with my
> personal archetype. Everything behind the interface that bisected my
> body front to back was pitch black. I immediately felt the familiar
> presence of the Supreme Being. He was right there with me. I could see

> without a trace. I was enshrouded in the Supreme Being's aura of
> loving protective energy. I could visually see it filling an area of
> the room around me. I could feel His loving protection. I knew it was
> Him.
>
> My perception of the room soon returned partly to normal but there was
> a semitransparent quality to all form that persisted. That loving

> like a loving father the rest of the afternoon and evening. His aura
> was with me as I prepared dinner, ate and did the dishes. He stayed
> with me until I went to bed that night. The demonic monster never

>
> **Bankruptcy:**
>
> The second book was finished, typed up, photocopied and more

>
> **FOREWORD**
>
> In recent years we have been besieged by such a host of books on
> business and its organization, that one might expect that at least a
> few of them would have approached the question of organization itself.
> How is experience organized? Is there an organizational imperative
> implicit in the nature of experience? If so how does it work? How do
> we integrate experience as individuals and does this have a bearing on
> our collective endeavors? Is there a direct relationship between the
> individual and collective integration of experience in a business
> enterprise, or in the social enterprise of humanity generally? If
> there is, we ought to seek it out. If we can discover how it works,
> then we can surely find great advantage in structuring our
> organizations accordingly.
>
> This is a book that pursues the discovery and the practical
> application of structural principles in business that are implicit in
> the nature of experience generally. There is a story involved, in
> which the reader is cast as the central character. In this way it is
> hoped that you will discover how to apply *two structural constraints*
> to optimum advantage. These two constraints are both necessary and
> sufficient to properly structure any business organization, such that
> it relates to itself and to its environment in a creative,
> responsible, and transparent way. Each participant can see their part
> and their place, in relation to the whole organization, through *three
> dimensions* that come into focus as a natural consequence of employing
> the two structural constraints. As the President of a company, in
> unusual circumstances, you find a way to work this out.
>
> The superior effectiveness of such an organization derives from an
> enhanced perception of the *potential* dimension, the *commitment*
> dimension and the *performance* dimension, for these three dimensions
> have their correlates in the integration of human experience. The
> intuitive, right brain development of idea derives its *potential*
> through a treasury of memory. Explicit technique is the key to our
> left brain *commitment* to endeavors that relate to our social
> organization. We assess our *perfor-*
>
> *mance* via feedback from our emotional limbic brain that fuels our
> animated responses to the ongoing stream of circumstance.
>
> It thus becomes possible to structure business organizations to
> function in accord with how we ourselves are biologically structured
> to function as ordinary human beings. We can be more responsive and
> more creative in a more spontaneous way. The need for bureaucratic
> controls and behavioral manipulation falls away, along with the
> political infighting that becomes so deeply entrenched in these kinds
> of organizations. The benefits become apparent in the redemption of
> wasted efforts, lost opportunities, abandoned talents, and the
> enormous costs that they represent, not only to business
> organizations, but to the people that constitute them, and to the
> cultures that we must serve in a constructive way in order to survive.

######## CHAPTER 1

> A GENERAL DISCUSSION
>
> Organization. It is a strange word. It means different things in
> different contexts.
>
> "How so?" you might say. "The context itself is organized in some way.
> So how can the word mean different things. Organization is
> organization."
>
> "What about chaos then? Is random order a form of organization?"
>
> You think for a moment to be sure of your answer. "Well, chaos
> certainly needs an observer to be identified as such." You are
> confident that you have found a handle on the question. "And it can
> only be known as such in relation to order. By its nature, chaos must
> be one face of some kind of order. Otherwise we would not be able to
> identify it."
>
> "Hmmm. Is that really so? Maybe the only order is chaos, and apparent
> orders that may emerge within it from time to time are transient
> phenomena, a mere passing expression of chaos."
>
> You look at me like I was the accused in the prisoner's dock. "Why
> that's utterly absurd. You are being less than honest."
>
> "Me? Less than honest?" I'm a little annoyed.
>
> "Yes, you. There are ordered assumptions implicit in your statement
> that render it so much double talk."
>
> "Double talk is it?! How so?"
>
> "Well examine the statement with just a little impartiality. Can't you
> see that saying 'from time to time' implies a sequential order of time
> that is fundamental even to chaos? Can't you see that identifying
> transient phenomena implies an observer with a sufficiently ordered
> mind and sensory apparatus to perceive events in a spatial order of
> things?"
>
> "Yes. I suppose I see what you mean. A good point. But then perhaps
> the ordered mind and sensory apparatus are themselves just a transient
> expression of chaos, an accidental order that will ultimately pass
> into oblivion along with the perception of the passing."
>
> 2 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> You squint at me through your reading glasses. "You really are a case.
> Now you are saying that chaos is oblivion. Can't you see that? And
> oblivion it must be if it is the *only* order. Random order is a
> homogeneous annihilation without ordered phenomena. But then we
> wouldn't be around to worry each other about it, would we?!"
>
> "I suppose not."
>
> "Of course not! A totally random order is not consistent with the
> ordered universe that we see around us. Such chaos as may exist is but
> one aspect of the order that sustains the whole of the universe."
>
> "And who is to say that this universe is real? There is nothing
> permanent about it. Why it is changing every instant, mere passing
> episodes in a dream. The whole thing is no more than an
> illusion."[1](#_bookmark2)
>
> "Why that rubbish is just more double talk." You shake your head as if
> to rearrange your thoughts. "You really are a master at it. Now you
> are trying to say that both order and chaos are an illusion and that
> nothing is real. But that view must then itself be an illusion, and
> yet you maintain that it alone is real? Why, you are trying to say
> that the only reality is illusion. It is a contradiction in terms.
> Words lose their meaning, my friend."
>
> "My point exactly." I give you a big smile to rub the point in.
> "Unless you want to suggest that there is some permanence to meaning
> that can survive the chaotic transience of events."
>
> "Of course there is. There must be. Unless we are all totally mad, we
> must believe that."
>
> "Aha. But then you must believe that meaning inheres in an order that
> determines the nature of transience, and not in transient events
> themselves."
>
> "What's that? What fool notion are you trying to slip past me now?"
> "It is simple enough. You believe that meaning derives from an order
> that transcends space and time. This order cannot be identified as
>
> confined *in* space and time."[2](#_bookmark0)
>
> A suspicious expression invades your face. "Of course it can be
> identified. If I understand your meaning I see you before me. Your
> meaning is implicit in your person and the words that come out of your
> mouth!"
>
> "Not if I walk away, it's not. Does the meaning in my words walk away
> with me?"
>
> "Let's not be ridiculous. I have a memory of course. And the meaning
> of your words is associated with my memory of you."
>
> *Personal Organization •* 3
>
> "But the event itself is gone, no longer a reality. Neither I nor your
> memory of me determines the nature of meaning. I am not a permanent
> resident of your mind. And what are words but uttered sounds that have
> already passed. Where is the meaning in sounds?"
>
> "You can't be serious. Why it is the meaning we have learned to
> associate with them. We learn spoken language from the crib and the
> sand box. It is passed on from generation to generation. It is part of
> our culture, part of our collective experience."
>
> "So far so good. In other words, you believe that meaning is
> determined by an order that transcends transient events in space and
> time, just as I said."
>
> "Wait just a minute! You're twisting things around. I didn't say
> that."
>
> "Is that so! You said language was passed on from generation to
> generation. Surely this passing on from one generation to the next is
> a transient event, yet the meaning implicit in language is universally
> understood by everyone. Now how is this universal meaning possible if
> there is no common order implicit in experience that transcends the
> perpetual passing of events?"
>
> "That's a very good question. But let me twist things around for a
> change. How is universal meaning possible if there *is* such an order
> as you suggest?"
>
> "That's a fair question also. This order that transcends the passing
> of events also determines the organization of events, so that although
> events may be different in space and time, they are all organized in a
> similar way.[3](#_bookmark0) It is precisely this characteristic of
> experience that allows us to learn from experience and also to benefit
> from the experience of others."
>
> "What's that got to do with language?"
>
> "How else could we learn language from parents and friends?" "Now you
> are contradicting yourself again. You said at the outset
>
> that organization means different things in different contexts. Now
> you are saying that everything is organized in a similar way. You
> can't make a single straight statement."
>
> "There is no contradiction in what I said and both statements are
> straight."
>
> "What?" There is a puzzle etched in your intelligent face, now a
> caricature of itself. "Things are both the same and different? There's
> no contradiction in that?"

> "Not if you allow of hierarchies in experience. A tree may have many
> different branches, but they are all the same tree. And there may be
> many different trees of the same kind. And there may be many different
> kinds of trees, but they are all trees. And trees are just one kind of
> plant." "And plants are just one kind of life, etceteras. You are
> talking about groups and classes, not hierarchies, my friend." You
> toss me an intimidating look of disgust. "These are just distinctions
> of kind made
>
> convenient by language. You are twisting things around
> again."[4](#_bookmark0)
>
> "Not so! There is an ordered hierarchy hidden in the classification of
> all life forms that is essential to how they evolve and grow,
> irrespective of the diversity of species. In fact it is more general
> than that. The organization of the whole of experience is dependent
> upon a common hierarchy that is implicit in the way phenomena
> evolve."[5](#_bookmark1)
>
> "Now that's a mouthful!" You throw your head back and laugh. "You've

######## CHAPTER 2 PERSONAL ORGANIZATION

> Suppose that you are in a strange city in a strange country and a taxi
> has just dropped you off at a museum, miles from your hotel. You pay
> him. You enter the old gallery to sop up some history. Ninety minutes
> later you find that your wallet has been stolen. You remember a man
> bumping into you as you left the museum. You are left without one
> cent. You know no one and you don‟t speak the language. You begin to
> wander, wondering what to do. You are lost and a little confused. Of
> the few people you meet that can speak your language, none will help
> you. Your confusion grows. Then you stop and think, "I‟ve got to get
> organized." What do you mean?
>
> Before you lost your wallet you were organized, now without it you‟re
> not. You had a plan before, but the plan required money to execute.
> Now, without money, you need a new plan. The plan is your
> organization. It is a sequence of actions that will bring about a
> desired result. You can still do nothing without money, but you are
> carrying a camera worth a thousand dollars. "Can I convert this to
> cash?" you ask yourself. "Can I use it as collateral until I can have
> some money transferred from home or get a new credit card?" You can‟t
> get back to your hotel without money and you have no identification.
> Your passport is in your hotel room.
>
> You go into a camera shop and ask for the owner. He shuffles out from
> the back room, looks you up and down.
>
> "How can I help you?" he asks coolly.
>
> You shift from one foot to the other, feeling awkward. "My wallet was
> stolen," you say lamely. You are embarrassed by your circumstances.
>
> "In my shop?" he interjects before you have a chance to continue. "No,
> no. At\... at the museum."
>
> "And what has that to do with me?"
>
> 8 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> "Well, I thought you might advance me some money on my camera, enough
> to get me back to my hotel. Then I would return the money and collect

>
> "I do not deal in second hand cameras."
>
> "But as a favor, I thought you might make an exception. I have no
> money to get back to my hotel. I am lost."
>
> "Do you have some ID?"
>
> "In my wallet, of course, along with my credit cards. I am staying at

>
> He looks you up and down again. You‟re wearing dungarees and sneakers.
> The camera must be hot. You can see it on his face. "And I am the
> Pope. Leave my shop before I call the police!"
>
> You can‟t find a pawn shop. Nobody knows what you are talking about.
>
> You spot a bank down the street. You enter and walk past the tellers
> to an office area to the rear, behind a long marble counter. A young
> lady finally gets up from her desk and approaches you in a foreign
> language. You smile and explain that you only speak English. You are
> not a very cosmopolitan person. She calls another to take her place.
>
> "Yes sir. Can I help you?"
>
> "I would like to speak with the manager for a moment." After your last

>
> "Do you have an appointment?" "No, I‟m afraid not."
>
> "I‟m sorry. The manager is busy at the moment." "Is there an assistant

>
> She looks at you skeptically. "Perhaps you could tell me the nature of

>
> "It‟s a rather personal matter."

> "Well\... I suppose it could be classified as a loan." "Domestic or

> "Domestic I would think."

> "And which company is that? Do you have a business card?"

"And your position with the company?"

She‟ll never believe it. You must fabricate something quickly. "Ac-

>
> "Please wait a moment." She picks up a phone, looks at you strangely,
> makes a call that you do not understand, then directs you through a
> gate in the marble counter, past a row of desks into one of several

> "How can I help you?" he asks directly, his eyes doing a very careful

>
> "I am on a business trip, but today I have taken the opportunity to

>
> "What is the nature of your problem?"
>
> "I was robbed. A pickpocket at the museum." "Surely you need a

>
> "A policeman cannot help me. There is no chance to find the pickpocket

>
> "A hundred dollars. Just a hundred until tomorrow. You must know that

>
> "I am not a thief! I am the victim of a thief! I am staying at the

>
> "Why should I bother. We cannot loan you money on a camera. I am a

>
> "Then let me use your phone." "There are phones outside."
>
> "I have no coins for a pay phone."
>
> He sighs, shrugs and sits back down. "The Sheraton?" "Yes."
>
> He looks up the number and dials, waits for a reply then hands you the

>
> Yes, the hotel had processed your credit card when you checked-in.
> Yes, they will advance you cash for the taxi upon arrival at the
> hotel. You had a platinum card. Just good business. You hang up

>
> "Why do you want my card?" he asks, a little perturbed.
>
> "Why, to thank the management of this bank for your cooperation, of
> course. Without that phone call, I don‟t know what I would have done."
>
> He hands you a card with reluctance. He is beginning to see possible

>
> You shake his hand anyway and give him a big smile. At least you are
> assured of a place to eat and sleep. You know where you are going
>

>
> and what you have to do. You are back on schedule. You are organized

>
> This personal organization concerns the integration of a series of

> There are many shapes and sizes of trees in the forest.1
>
> There is a certain incongruity in all of this, because the word
> organization implies something more organic than just directed
> activities in a linear series. It implies a delegation of different
> activities to different organs that are interdependent in their

> departments. There is an independent delegation of certain functions,

>
> In one‟s personal organization this delegation does not occur in a

######## CHAPTER 5

> THE COUNTRY TOWN
>
> You can see the mountains in the distance, but you have rarely been
> exposed to the people that live there. Sometimes you may see them at
> the market, but you don't speak their language and they don't speak
> much of yours. They have been in your shop. They may come to buy a few
> things now and then, but otherwise they keep to themselves in the
> mountains. If you want to go there to see them you must walk many
> miles, and it would be risky to go alone. The tribes may make no
> permanent claim on a specific piece of ground, but the mountains have
> always belonged to them. Your life is confined mainly to your business
> in the country town where you have always lived.
>
> An old woman has been browsing through your shop. She finally puts two
> small sacks of rice and a plastic bucket on the counter.
>
> You add it up on your calculator and let her see. "One hundred and
> twenty baht."
>
> "One hundred," she says.
>
> "I cannot," you say. " There's little profit." "There's no profit for
> me," she smiles.
>
> "Today, a special price for you. One hundred and ten baht."
>
> She reaches into her bag and puts down one hundred and five on the
> counter. Four wrinkled up twenties, two old tens and a five baht coin.
> "That's all I have." She puts on a sweet look. You know she never has
> enough money.
>
> "Very special. For you only," you say. She gives you a nice thank you,
> puts the rice in the bucket and leaves.
>
> A young woman enters, wearing blue jeans and a man's cotton shirt.
> "Give me 5, 7, 9 and 8, 2, 4," she says. She hands you forty baht.
>
> You write the numbers on a piece of paper, initial it, and give it to

>
> better and still be ahead because you don't have to cover all the
> numbers and come across for the really big prizes. Your only overhead
> is a modest contribution to the local police.
>
> Then you have the rice barn as well. You buy rice at competitive
> prices at the end of the harvest when the price is low. And you sell
> it a few months later at fifty percent profit, when rice is not
> plentiful. Most of the farmers have only five or ten acres, not enough
> to afford them a rice barn that would allow them to wait for better
> prices. They hardly have enough money to wait for the harvest. But
> that often gives you the opportunity to make short term loans at very
> high interest rates, with the harvest as collateral. Of course you
> pride yourself that the rates you charge are lower than some others.
> All in all, you do very well. You have two sons in university and a
> daughter in high school. Another daughter, married with a baby, lives
> next door.
>
> Even in a country town of a few thousand people, things are very
> different from a tribal village. There are many organs of
> interdependent function in its organization. There is a post office, a
> police detachment, two schools, three temples, a car dealership, three
> motorcycle shops, two gas stations, some district government offices,
> a market, a farmers cooperative, some street vendors, a wholesale
> warehouse, a bus station, several small restaurants, shops selling
> manufactured goods of many kinds, clothing shops, a gambling house
> that subsidizes police income and keeps taxes in check, likewise a
> brothel, the town offices, the electric power authority, a traditional
> massage parlor, two banks, a small hotel, a trucking company, a
> district hospital, two small medical clinics, a dental clinic, two
> drug stores, a Chinese herbalist, a small supermarket, a bakery, an
> electronics shop and service center, a movie theater, a hotel, a
> welding shop, a furniture store, a local furniture manufacturer, two
> small building contractors, a lumber yard with building supplies, a
> repair garage, several beauty salons and barber shops, a lawyer's
> office, two plumbing contractors with plumbing supplies, a heavy
> equipment rental business, two electrical contractors, and
> miscellaneous others.
>
> It is noteworthy that nearly all of these specialized outlets are
> still functional in character, just as the job of village blacksmith,
> or mule skinner, or seamstress is functional in character. There are
> differences within this functional context, however. At the village
> level there is usually no boss giving directions to a number of
> employees under his or her authority, while at the town level there
> frequently is, in many of the establishments. For instance the police
> detachment of seven men will have a police sergeant or a lieutenant,
> who is in command, although he may
>
> *The Country Town •* 27
>
> also perform normal police duties himself. Likewise the post office,
> with a staff of eight, will have a working postmaster, for these
> functions are not sufficiently complex at the town level to incur
> genuine supervisory work. Many of the shops may also have a small
> sales staff responsible to the shop owner. Leaders at this level are
> functional leaders, like a team leader, a foreman, a working chief, or
> a school principal.
>
> There will be some specialization of function within some of the
> larger enterprises. For example the small furniture manufacturer may
> have a few sales people, an accountant with a clerk or two, several
> carpenters with a complement of apprentices, a few upholsterers, a
> number of laborers and general maintenance people, two truck drivers,
> and some security guards. The point is that once again all of these
> various jobs will be essentially functional in character, even though
> they relate organically to one another within the context of the
> business. The people have the required skills to function
> independently, and the results expected are known. The routines are
> preset by precedent and by the way the manufacturing area, yard,
> office, and show room are organized. The products are of a standard
> variety, and are normally automatically replenished as they move out
> to the customer. This *functional* type of work is focused primarily
> on repetitive task cycles associated with the manufacturing operation.
>
> The owner of the factory doesn't usually have to give many
> instructions, although his is the only job that is not entirely
> functional in character. Normally, however, part of his day is taken
> up with the simple functional task of inspection, to make sure the
> work is up to standard, on time, and so on. But he must also ensure
> that sufficient materials are ordered in time, that they are received
> in good condition and approve invoices for payment accordingly. He
> must ensure that the payroll is reasonably equitable between the
> various employees, taking into account special skills and talents,
> length of service, availability, and so on. He must ensure that
> product quality is maintained, that prices are both sufficient to
> cover costs and competitive, and that customers pay promptly. He must
> ensure that the company premises are adequate for the work on hand and
> expected in the future. He must ensure that equipment and
> manufacturing techniques are efficient and up to date. In some cases
> he must personally maintain some key customer contacts that are vital
> to the retail sale of his products, perhaps in neighboring towns. This
> work of ensuring the proper commitment of material, labor and
> operating facilities is supervisory by its nature, as distinct from
> functional. It is concerned with maintaining a productive flow of
> recurrent product cycles, as

######## CHAPTER 6 THE NATION CITY

>
> "We didn't anticipate such a large increase," you reply caustically.

>
> \`For example, when the construction manager initiates a project, he

> begin---houses, townhouses, shophouses, factories, offices, high-rise

> employ people to schedule them accordingly, and to keep track of their
> time and progress, the equipment and the materials they use. You must

> cycles, as opposed to their application to specific tasks. Supervisory
> work implicitly gives direction to functional work. In any case, the
> mainstream activity in your company is construction, associated with
> property development. This is you main product work.
>
> The Design Department employs both architects and engineers, although
> some large projects may be designed or engineered on a contractual
> basis by outside consultants, under preliminary design guidelines
> specified by this department. There are also draftsmen, a scheduling
> function to maintain proper priorities, surveyors, cost estimators,
>
> *The Nation City •* 39
>
> junior engineers and technologists preparing contract documents,
> material specifications and purchase requisitions, and engineering
> inspectors. All of these interdependent functions are organized under
> the department head at the senior supervisory level. In some companies
> this design activity may go under various names, such as Engineering,
> Planning, Product Development, Research, and the like. They are all
> concerned with developing the product idea.
>
> The Sales Manager also works at the supervisory level. Under his
> direction are groups of people performing various specialized
> functions. There is a group of sales people who maintain direct
> contacts with potential buyers and who service consummated sales
> accounts. In the case of commercial and industrial sales this may
> involve detailed coordination with other departments for the design,
> construction, and financing of specialized premises in commercial
> complexes or industrial estates. There is also the task of pricing
> projects, in the light of both project costs and market competition.
> There is the job of preparing and monitoring the terms and conditions

> interfacing with engineering and construction scheduling to ensure
> that projects can be delivered on time in accordance with contract
> commitments. Of course there will also be an advertising function, and
> forecasting. Similar activities are involved in any sales department.
>
> The Financial Manager too has specialized groups performing
> interdependent functions. The largest of these account for
> expenditures and revenues, the usual job of accounting according to
> established procedures and producing reports. There is also the vital
> task of maintaining adequate cash flow to finance the various

> through various banking and financial arrangements. There is the
> compilation of the annual budget from submissions by the various
> departments, together with quarterly and annual stockholder's reports.
> Then there is the job of arranging various financing strategies for
> domestic, commercial and industrial customers. There will also be
> someone delegated the task of monitoring the system of accounts and
> assigning account numbers. These financial tasks are familiar to every
> sizable company.
>
> At this point in the growth of your organization, the Personnel

>
> Likewise the acquisitions function does not yet amount to a full

> acquiring land functions accordingly. Although he is a senior,
> knowledgeable person, he works very closely with you, essentially at a
> senior functional level. In these Personnel and Marketing areas you
> thus continue to work at a *supervisory* level.
>
> As President of the company, you have a different relationship with
> the other four department managers that work at a supervisory level.
> They must determine how best to commit the resources at their disposal
> to achieve the desired results. It is you who must balance the needs

>
> To be sure quality improved for a while, until the novelty wore off.
> Then the hostility set in, along with subversive tactics to defeat the

> PROFIT DISTRIBUTION FOR SURVIVAL ADVANTAGE
>
> You have spent most of the last several weeks in a hotel suite in
> Bangkok, hassling with a bevy of lawyers and financial people. Your
> Acquisitions Manager did indeed find a partly completed project
> exactly suited to your needs. You are undertaking the purchase of a
> large development that has been stalled due to financial difficulties
> before construction could be completed. It consists of a thirty-six
> story office tower, and a thirty-two story hotel tower, joined by a
> shopping complex and parking garage, with plans for a future
> condominium development adjacent. It‟s in a prime Bangkok location on
> Soi Asoke.
>
> "Seven thousand million baht (about two hundred and eighty million
> dollars) sounds like a lot of money to invest in one location in
> Bangkok. And we can add another thousand million for completion of the
> complex." Your Financial Manager, Fin, is looking out the window at
> the traffic jam below.
>
> "It‟s not too late to pull out," you say. "Once we are in, we are in
> for a long time. Are you having second thoughts?"
>
> "The hotel and office rental market is very soft right now. The new
> Marketing man blames it on the gulf war followed by the military coup.
> He seems confident that things will improve in a few years. Does he
> really know? If he is right we should be in a very solid position."
>
> You have hired a new manager, at the supervisory level, to head up a
> Marketing Department to identify and assess new ventures, do market
> surveys, keep abreast of trends, international influences, shifting
> patterns and needs, that sort of thing. We may call him Mark II. For
> the time being your Acquisitions Manager, Mark I, will still report
> directly to you. He is a long standing senior employee who will be due
> for retirement in a few years.
>
> 56 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> "No one can infallibly assess the future," you say. "But even if the
> market doesn‟t improve, we will still be in a good position. We won‟t
> be faced with the huge debt charges that sunk the current developers,
> together with material shortages and construction delays. The heavy
> construction is nearly finished and we are getting a good buy. This is
> a capital intensive business and we will own it comfortably. Things
> would have to get very bad before we found ourselves in trouble."
>
> "True enough. Perhaps it‟s just the thought of living in Bangkok and
> fighting the traffic and pollution every day that concerns me. I grew
> up in a country town, where there was fresh air and freedom of
> movement. There is not even a place for my children to play in this

>
> You have sensed his concerns for some time, and you are relieved that
> he has chosen to speak of them. It would be too late after he found

> planning authorities with their finger in the pie in Bangkok, and none

> Chicago."
>
> "I am amazed at that jungle out there. Only a dozen years ago the

>
> "I have some ideas about that." "Ideas? What kind of ideas?"
>
> "We will have some land to spare in the new complex. The condo

>
> *Profit Distribution For Survival Advantage •* 57
>
> "For all employees? From maintenance workers to managers?" He begins

>
> "Yes. We have been afforded a unique opportunity here. We have,

> we have an opportunity to compensate in some measure. We don‟t need to

>
> "An interesting thought. But what is to prevent our own employees from
> exploiting the resale of the units at exorbitant profit, and returning
> to their village up country? They come here for money, not because
> it‟s a nice place to live."
>
> "There are ways to curtail that. It can begin with restrictions in a
> rental purchase agreement in which full ownership only vests
> gradually, over a period of years, with the right of resale subject to
> further limitations."
>
> "Limitations?"
>
> "Limitations that can be reviewed by the community at large in the
> best interests of everyone. There would have to be a local council, as
> in any community. It would have to be formalized in a legal
> constitution."
>
> "But then this council would be at odds with the prevailing market
> forces in Bangkok. People that leave the company for whatever reason
> would be forced to sell at much less than they otherwise could." He
> turns and looks at you skeptically. "It sounds a bit pinko," he says.
> "It sounds like another totalitarian scheme."
>
> You smile. You like his forthrightness. "Not at all. No one is forced

58 • *Enlightened Management*

> Your Financial Manager is a good natured yet serious man. He begins
> looking down at the traffic again. "I was taught to believe that the

>
> "Are you suggesting that we ought not to be concerned with the living

>
> "I can see the merit in what you are suggesting. I am also realistic

>
> "Interesting that you should say that the goal of a company is to make

>
> He turns around to face you. "Surely you jest. One grows rice and
> makes electric fans in order to make a profit."
>
> "Then what is this profit that is made?"
>
> "Why it is money of course. It is value added as a result of growing

>
> "Ah. So then profit always comes as a result of making something

>
> "I suppose so, yes."
>
> "So then, by your own words, it is not a goal. It is a result. It is a

>
> "You are turning things around. We are in business for profit. We
> cannot survive without it. Everyone knows that."
>
> "Perhaps it is your business school training that has turned things

>
> He sits down in an armchair across the coffee table from you. He

>
> *Profit Distribution For Survival Advantage •* 59

> depends largely upon their skill, and upon their commitment to doing a
> job well. They know that they must be professional to get ahead."
>
> His directness is refreshing. "I have no argument with that. The point

> product of value in the market place. It does not relate to an empty
> demand for more money. Their profit comes from their earnings. Other

>
> "How is it misleading and damaging?"
>
> "It leads people to believe that they are manipulated and used for

>
> "Really, Pres. Isn‟t that overdoing it a bit? I know you have been

> must be developed to do so, the specific technology must be perfected,
> the production facilities acquired, and the employees trained, before
> production can begin. All of this work has to do with giving explicit
> form to knowledge consistent with product cycles. All six activities
> are involved, although they will not all be delegated at the
> administrative level.
>
> *Supervisory work gives form to routine and direction to behaviour*.
> Once the production facilities and other infrastructure and trained

######## CHAPTER 9

> A MEAL IN THE MARKET
>
> THE ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGE
>
> You have just sat down with your Personnel Officer at a wobbly old
> table in the market at Prathunam. You have wandered south from the
> Indra Hotel through a labyrinth of narrow walkways lined with stalls
> selling all manner of clothing and other goods, some of it made by the
> seamstresses plying their trade in the midst of the crowds jostling
> past. It is a place where many Thai people shop, since goods are a
> fraction of the prices demanded in the modern shopping malls that have
> sprung up all over in recent years. Fumes from gas fired woks drift
> through the large eating area where many concessionaires offer a
> variety of food for next to nothing. Each has an area sufficient for a
> few tables,
>
> You have ordered a bowl of bami heng. Your Personnel Officer has
> ordered bami nam. You have brought him here for a reason. You noticed
> his natural politeness with the waitress. He seems at home in
> surroundings where well to do people rarely come.
>
> "We are beginning a new adventure," you say. You have spent part of
> the day explaining to him some of your thoughts about the new
> organization and how to structure it. You have filled him in on your
> discussion with the Financial Manager the day before, especially about
> the community development for employees.
>
> "It is a very ambitious scheme," he remarks. "It will take a great
> deal of coordination and planning, particularly if you want employee
> input into the layout of the housing facilities."
>
> "That's where your department will come in. You will have to elicit
> ideas from those employees who will be living there and discuss them
> with all concerned."
>
> "The employees should perhaps select a housing committee from the
> outset," Perse says. He has always been oriented toward accommodating
> the opinions of others, if it can be done constructively. You like
>
> 80 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> that quality in him. "It would stimulate a lot of interest in the
> project," he adds.
>
> "A good idea, although you should provide a guiding hand. It could
> also act as a steering committee toward forming a permanent community
> government. Keep in mind that you will have to coordinate with our
> Design and Engineering Department to try and implement as many of the
> suggestions as are practical."
>
> "Our existing Design and Engineering Department? I was under the
> impression that the new commercial complex would be managed as a
> separate organization."
>
> "Yes. The new complex will be operated and maintained as a separate
> department. But this is something very different from developing the
> facilities in the first place. Operation is something distinct from
> design and construction. In the larger organizational context the
> latter is a Product Development activity, whereas the mainstream
> Product activity is the Operation of a rental business, the rental of
> hotel rooms, shopping mall and office space."1
>
> "So the new complex will be managed by a Vice President at the
> administrative level?" (It will be helpful to refer to Chapter 13,
> Chart 2.) "That's correct," you reply. "He will be responsible for
> many employees, from hotel receptionists and dining room chefs to
> mechanical and electrical technicians. These people must be organized
> into depart-
>
> ments within his department."2
>
> "Will there be a Product Development activity within the department
> then?"
>
> "Of course. This will entail the technical Maintenance of the
> facilities, the electrical system, air conditioning, water supply,
> waste treatment and disposal, telephone and electronic systems, that
> sort of thing. It will also entail an interior decorating unit,
> concerned with refurbishing the facilities on a periodic basis, and
> also a building maintenance group, window washers and so on."
>
> "Then it is only significant changes to the facilities, as opposed to
> their maintenance, that would entail input from the Design and
> Engineering Department."
>
> "Right. When that happens, the Maintenance activity will interface and
> coordinate with Design and Engineering. Otherwise the two departments
> will operate independently."
>
> "What about the financial activity of the new complex? Will it have
> its own accounting section, budgeting, account systems organization,
>
> *A Meal in the Market The Organizational Challenge •* 81
>
> finance and so on? Will there be six activities delegated within the
> new department's financial activity?"
>
> "It may have these four that you mention, and perhaps also some
> functional delegation in a profit distribution activity to determine
> limits of flexibility in room rates and salaries. The remaining
> activity, fiscal research, will not be delegated in normal
> circumstances. The point is that the delegated activities will focus
> on the internal needs of the department. For example the hotel, office
> and shopping complex must know who has paid their bills and who
> hasn't. It must also have a cost accounting function to assess it's
> own efficiency. And of course it must prepare an annual operating and
> capital budget. It therefore must have a system of collecting the
> essential data, and there must be a degree of local flexibility in
> assigning account numbers to reflect the department's needs. These
> will be small functional groups within a financial section reporting
> to a Financial Manager at the supervisory level who reports to the
> Vice President in charge of operating the whole complex."
>
> Perse looks concerned. "Won't this lead to conflict with the Financial
> Vice President of the company? Won't he consider this his turf?"
>
> "On the contrary, it should avoid conflict. Just because there is a
> similarity in functional character between these activities doesn't
> mean that they must be grouped into the Financial Department for the
> company as a whole. The Financial VP shouldn't be concerned with who
> has paid their hotel bill and who hasn't. He can't devise a system to
> monitor this without interfering with the VP responsible for running
> the hotel. Neither can the Financial VP prepare an operating and
> capital budget, for he knows nothing about the hotel business. Nor can
> he devise a means of efficiently costing aspects of its operation. The
> occasional costing of certain task cycles may be necessary to
> determine the best way to do something, or it may be critical to
> pricing, as in food preparation for instance. Since we have this
> marvelous invention called a computer, we can make it work for us if
> we build sufficient flexibility into an overall system of accounts. We
> can allow for a further breakdown of subsidiary accounts for the
> control and use of other operating departments."
>
> "Then these financial activities essential to hotel operation would
> interface with corresponding activities in the Financial Department?
> For example it seems obvious that a budgeting activity, associated
> with the hotel, must interface with the budgeting activity of the
> Finance Depart-
>
> 82 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> ment. Likewise an accounting activity. Would this be true also of
> finance policy, and the system of accounts?"
>
> "In general it would work this way, yes. However, the last two
> activities that you mention, although important to the operation of
> the hotel, may each be performed by one or two persons, and perhaps
> not full time."
>
> "A part time activity? I thought it was a general rule that no
> employee could be delegated work in more than one of the six regions
> of activity."
>
> "This is the first structural constraint, yes. Only at the functional
> level of work may one man sometimes wear two hats, so long as he
> reports independently to the appropriate supervisor under whom the
> functional activity naturally falls. The point is that it is essential
> to maintain perception into the three dimensions at all levels in the
> organization. But yes, each activity would interface with a
> corresponding activity in the Finance Department, and the other
> departments as well for that matter. It is important to recognize that
> this interface provides a common basis for communication between
> equals. Each has their separate delegated area of responsibility and
> authority, with a mutual focus in common. One is not in a dominant
> position over the other."
>
> The waitress brings the food, also chopsticks and spoons. "What would
> you like to drink?" she asks.
>
> "Water with ice. It's a hot evening," replies your Personal Officer.
>
> The waitress gives him a warm smile, and straightens her dress.
>
> "I'll have the same," you say pleasantly. She ignores you and leaves.
> A moment later she returns with two bottles of water and an ice
> bucket, with another warm smile for your personnel man. He is a good
> looking chap of thirty-seven. He doesn't take special notice of her
> attention.
>
> "If there are corresponding activities within each major department
> that interface in this way, then there must also be a personnel
> activity reporting to the VP of the new complex. Is that correct?" he
> asks.
>
> "Yes. There will have to be a Personnel Officer working at a senior
> functional level, much like the job that you are doing now."
>
> "You mean he will screen new employees, keep employee records, mediate
> disputes, keep track of salary reviews, that sort of thing?"
>
> "Essentially yes. At the functional level."
>
> "Then this new Personnel Officer in this new division will interface
> with me?"
>
> *A Meal in the Market The Organizational Challenge •* 83
>
> "No. He will interface with someone that works for you. You are due
> for a promotion. In fact you are due for two promotions at once."
>
> "Two?" He lays his chop sticks across the edge of the bowl and looks
> at you. He is both surprised and puzzled. He takes a sip of water.
>
> You have already decided. You have worked closely with this man for
> ten years. You know him well. He has the kind of human sensibilities
> that you feel are so important in personnel work. People like him. He
> is also highly intelligent and honest. His personal integrity is above
> reproach. You finish your bami heng before answering. "You are going
> to be Personnel VP. If you want the job that is. And I hope that you
> do. I don't know where else I would turn."
>
> "You are offering me a promotion from a functional level job, all the
> way to an administrative level job, skipping the supervisory level in
> the middle? Why?"
>
> You are surprised by such a direct question. You look at him for a
> moment and smile. "You needn't think it is a personal favor. The
> organization is making a giant leap. In better circumstances, perhaps
> I could retain the administrative level of Personnel undelegated, but
> in our current situation great demands are being placed on my time and
> I cannot devote the attention it deserves. These special circumstances
> demand a Personnel VP. You will have your work cut out for you, and I
> don't know of anyone better suited for the job."
>
> He pores another glass of water, takes a long drink, and puts the
> glass down. He suddenly seems full of apprehensions. "I am not sure I
> will know what to do," he says. "You might be better advised to
> advertise for someone with more experience."
>
> "What good is more experience if it is of the wrong kind. We are
> heading into some virgin territory. We have new concepts to guide us
> toward a more responsive organization. We may make a few mistakes
> initially, but the structure of the organization will be such as to
> bring them to the fore. Mistakes are not irreversible in a responsible
> organization, for it is also a learning organization."
>
> "You seem very clear on these concepts. You have obviously given the
> matter a lot of thought. But as I sit here thinking about it, I cannot
> readily identify the six activities of the company's Personnel
> activity. The mainstream activity seems clear enough. I assume that it
> corresponds to the work that I do now. But I only have one assistant
> and a clerk/secretary at present."3
>
> 84 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> "The first thing that you must do is hire someone to replace you.
> Perhaps you can promote your assistant and hire a few to replace him.
> But the nature of the mainstream activity will also change."
>
> "Change how?"
>
> "We will have to formalize the organization structure and this may
> lead to an employee union for example. Then we would be into union
> negotiations, grievance procedures and so on. It would be desirable to
> avoid an outside union if we can. The best way to do this might be to
> formalize a grievance procedure as soon as possible. Then there is the
> matter of the new community development. This task alone will employ
> someone reasonably senior and experienced full time." (It will be
> helpful to refer to Chapter 19, Chart 8, for an overview of the
> Personnel Department. )
>
> "But won't the new housing program come under the jurisdiction of the
> new Operations VP. After all, most of the people living there will
> work for him."
>
> "Is that a good reason to have their housing come under his influence
> as well? Should I, as President, not have independent feedback from so
> vital a function as the administration of employee housing? Can I
> afford to lose all prerogative of decision over so important a matter
> and establish another employee with an isolated empire in my stead?
> And not everyone living there will be in his employ. I hope to have an
> apartment there myself. So might you, and other key members of the
> parent organization. Our head offices will be moved to the new office
> building as soon as it is completed."
>
> "I see what you mean. Yes, one must be very, very careful to avoid
> structural problems. Doesn't that require that the problem of
> structuring the organization must be carefully analyzed by someone
> assigned to this task? Shouldn't that also be a personnel activity?"
>
> "Absolutely. That activity corresponds to the personnel activity
> within the Personnel Department. The complexity of our organization
> will warrant independent delegation of this function under your
> administration and initially under your supervision."
>
> "Let me see if I have this clear then. There is a polar relationship
> between the mainstream activity of maintaining a complement of
> competent, experienced staff, and the structuring activity. One might
> call the former a personnel support activity, and the latter an
> organizational analysis activity."
>
> *A Meal in the Market The Organizational Challenge •* 85
>
> "Support is a good way to think of the mainstream activity. In
> screening candidates for a particular job, you do not normally make
> the final decision yourself. You may make recommendations, or offer
> several choices. You may even have a power of veto. But the final
> choice normally rests with the person to whom the candidate will
> report, together with the next superior up the line. Then of course
> there are the other associated functions to do with support, including
> housing in the new complex. On the other hand, the organizational
> analysis activity also includes the writing of clear and concise job
> descriptions for every job in the company. In a large organization it
> is necessary to formalize job descriptions consistent with the

> once people understand how it works, every job is clear in relation to

> one actual at present, and a model structure toward which the
> organization should move as opportunities present themselves. But
> whatever the case, the complement of personnel must be maintained in

>
> "So this polarity provides insight into the *commitment* dimension of

>
> "That is correct."
>
> "If we move on to consider the *potential* dimension of the Personnel

>
> "What do you mean by company ideals?"

> You adjust your glasses as you prepare to put on a good performance.

> "It must have to do with employee benefits." "You mean salaries?"
>
> "Partly. We must devise equitable pay scales, taking into account the

>
> "So then the level of training, in the broadest sense, has a polar
> relationship to the level of financial remuneration?"
>
> "This seems to be the case, at least in ideal circumstances. But then
> there are other considerations. For instance there are natural talents
> that may still require training, but which no degree of training could
> emulate in a person lacking the talent. We can't all be Einsteins or
> Mozarts. There may also be inherent risks or hardships in a job that
> should command extra compensation, steel workers on tall buildings for
> example. Then there is the level of responsibility to consider. If a
> maintenance worker spills paint on the floor it may ruin a carpet, but
> if you make a serious mistake in structuring the organization, it may
> ruin the whole company. All of these things are reflected in the level
> of financial compensation."
>
> "Then let's substitute the word competence for training, since

> 88 • *Enlightened Management*

> to enhance this. To this extent then, this activity of human

> "Of course. The financial activity of personnel includes establishing

######## CHAPTER 11 PACKAGING A PRODUCT

> You have just entered a swank private club in Chonburi province with
> your Sales Manager. A hostess greets him warmly, by name. He reminds
> her of his reservation in the Sabai Room. Sabai is a word that can
> mean various things in the Thai language: pleasure, comfort,
> contentment, satisfaction---all rolled into one, and more on occasion.
>
> Several days have passed since your discussions about organization
> structure with your newly appointed Finance VP and Personnel VP.
> Although you haven‟t yet had an opportunity to make official
> announcements about these appointments, the news has obviously leaked.
> Perhaps you intended the leak. There was nothing secret. The news is
> also out that an agreement to purchase the new complex has been
> finalized and officially signed. There is no turning back now.
>
> You remove your shoes and proceed past a large richly appointed dining
> area with traditional musicians and dancers. As you enter the Sabai
> Room beyond, the lighting becomes very dim. There is a jungle
> waterfall in the center of the room. Tiny bulbs are set in a high
> ceiling like stars, their intensity changing in twinkling patterns.
> Another hostess greets your Sales Manager by name. She escorts you to
> a private compartment with low seating, upholstered in silk. Large
> silk cushions are placed around the perimeter. A candle is guttering
> beside a floral arrangement on a low teak table. A dim Chinese lantern
> is suspended from a drop ceiling above. As you sit down on opposite
> sides of the table, the hostess retreats with a graceful wai, drawing
> the screen closed behind her. Very cozy.
>
> Your Sales Manager insisted upon bringing you here. You are beginning
> to wonder what kind of seduction he has in mind. Your first
> inclination was to decline the invitation, but you have learned that
> sometimes these situations can be very instructive, if you give those
> that contrive them sufficient leeway.
>
> 112 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> "Nice place,‟ you say. "Very private."
>
> He chuckles, his eyes gleaming. "Very nice. And the service is sabai,
> sabai. Have you been here before?"
>
> "My first encounter. But you seem to be well known by all." He shrugs.
> "It is one of the obligations of my job."
>
> You are about to say something when the screen opens and two very
> beautiful young women in kimonos enter. They wai graciously and kneel
> at the end of the table. You raise your eyebrows. What is this? A
> geisha house Thai style?
>
> Your Sales Manager is watching you closely and grinning. "This is Khun
> Lek and Khun Tuk, Sir. They are our personal hostesses for the
> evening."
>
> "You reserved them specially?"
>
> "Of course, Sir. They are not only attractive, they are very
> cultured."
>
> "I can see that." Tuk is smiling alluringly at you.
>
> "Lek is making eyes at Sal and giggling a little. He is giving her
> signals to cool it a bit. They are obviously well acquainted.
>
> Tuk leans forward toward you. The offered glimpse down the loose front
> of her kimono confirms that she is well endowed. "Would you care for
> some liquid refreshment, Sir?"
>
> You shift a little uncomfortably. Is this young beauty unnerving you?
> You are old enough to be her father with a decade to spare. Or is it
> the compromising nature of the circumstances? Just what exactly does
> Sal have in mind?
>
> Lek interjects. "We have the best imported wines, Sir. And also a full
> range of cocktails."
>
> "Would you like to see a menu, Sir?" Tuk leans forward again, smiling,
> exposing another glimpse of her wares. Your blood quickens a beat. You
> wonder what your wife would say if she could see you now. After so
> many years together she would probably laugh.
>
> "Perhaps some wine. Red. Beaujolais would be fine."
>
> "Nonsense, Sir." Sal laughs with a wave of his hand. "This is a
> special occasion. We must christen the new acquisition. Champagne. A
> magnum of Mums. And bring glasses for yourselves. Also an aperitif.
> Shrimp cocktails."
>
> You are still aware of the kimono poised perilously in front of you.
> Then Tuk rises as easily as a leaf on the breeze and disappears
> through the screen with Lek.
>
> *Packaging a Product •* 113
>
> "Very nice young ladies, Sir. And the food here is heavenly."
>
> Your Sales Manager is making efforts at being especially obsequious
> tonight, but is not quite succeeding. He has deliberately contrived
> these circumstances with some motive in mind. You know that. He knows
> that you know that.
>
> "Why have you brought me here?" you ask pointedly. You are depending
> on the direct approach to maintain some semblance of propriety. He
> smiles. "I thought you might enjoy a relaxing evening, Sir. You have
> been working very hard on the new acquisition. You deserve a night
> out." He is trying to make it appear as a gratuitous gesture. He knows
> there has been a lot of tension for you over the past few weeks.
>
> You may be vulnerable. "I have heard that the agreement to purchase is
> finalized at last. Is that correct, Sir?" he asks.
>
> "Yes. Everything is in order to proceed now. In fact the wheels have
> already begun to turn,"
>
> "Which wheels are those, Sir?"
>
> "We have begun to reassess the design, to the extent that we may still
> have an opportunity to modify the final stages of construction to suit
> our needs. And the Construction Department has already assembled an
> inspection group on site to insure quality control, safety and
> security."
>
> "I heard that Des and Con were down to Bangkok for a few negotiation
> sessions. Quite frankly I expected to be called into the matter
> myself."
>
> He is trying a dash of the direct approach too. Clever. He gets you
> into a compromising situation, then he probes for faults. Perhaps you
> could have kept him better informed. But there were more urgent things
> on your mind, and you knew the grapevine was working overtime.
>
> "Sales has not been a primary concern up until now," you point out.
> "The priority issues have been the financial terms of the agreement,
> together with contractual matters relating to the design and
> construction of the complex with consultants and contractors."
>
> "Perse has also been involved. It seems that I have been the only one
> left out."
>
> "That‟s correct. There are reasons for this. The organization will
> have to grow very quickly. It is imperative that our Personnel

> organizational needs. A number of key people must be hired
> immediately, with hundreds to follow over the next eighteen months."
>
> 114 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> "I understand that," he says slowly, choosing his words. "There is
> also the matter of leasing the shopping mall and office space. From
> what I hear, these buildings will be ready for occupancy within a

>
> "Where are you getting your information?"
>
> "Rumors abound. I am also sufficiently acquainted with the project to
> know."
>
> "You have done some investigation on your own?"
>
> "I consider it an obligation to show a little initiative in my job,
> yes. I must keep informed of the market in my business. I must know
> what‟s happening. Sales is very competitive these days."
>
> "And it has an associated marketing activity." You are trying to steer
> the conversation in another direction. You are hoping that he will
> take the bait.
>
> "I have wondered. Why have you hired a new Marketing Manager divorced
> from my department? Quite frankly I don‟t quite understand your recent
> attitude toward my department, Sir." He is being unusually direct for
> a change, but in a conciliatory manner.
>
> "The new Marketing man was hired a few months ago. I thought I had
> explained my reasons then. This Marketing Department is not concerned

>
> "But a moment ago you said that Marketing is a Sales activity." "No. I

>
> "It sounds the same to me. What difference does it make to turn the

>
> "It is a matter of context. In the context of the whole company,
> Marketing is an activity independent from Sales. Within the context of
> Sales, the marketing activity has a different focus."
>
> "Different how?"
>
> "The Marketing Department concerns the direction of the whole company.
> The Sales Department marketing activity concerns the direction of the

>
> Soft music has begun to play in your carrel. There are stereo speakers

>
> The screen opens. Tuk enters first with the magnum immersed in an ice

>
> Tuk wipes the bottle with a towel and holds it out for your

>
> "I am sure it will be fine."
>
> She proceeds to open the bottle and pore some in a glass for you to

>
> "It will be fine, I am sure."
>
> She fills the glass and sets it on the table in front of you. Then she

>
> Sal lifts his glass. "To your health, Sir."
>
> Tuk and Lek follow suit. "To your health, Sir."
>
> "And to your‟s," you reply, as you lift your glass and take a sip.
>
> No sooner have you set the glass down than Tuk offers you a delicious

> Sal lifts his glass again. "To the success of the new acquisition."

>
> 116 • *Enlightened Management*

> dimensions of the Sales Department may be summarized as follows:
> *Commitment Dimension:* The *Sales* activities have a polar
> relationship to the *Organization* activity concerned with structuring
> and scheduling the sales activities, thus providing insight into the
> commitment dimension. But there are two independently organized Sales
> activities that are administered in parallel by the Sales VP. One is
> concerned with local and regional property sales, the other with
> international sales encompassing the hotel complex also. Each of these
> two parallel activities has an independent polar relationship to the
> *Organization* activity, making for two parallel *Commitment
> Dimensions* that must independently find balance with the other two
> dimensions*.*
>
> *Potential Dimension:* The *Sales Policy* activity has a polar
> relationship to the *Pricing Policy* activity thus providing insight
> into the potential dimension of the department.
>
> *Performance Dimension:* The *Sales Forecasting* activity has a polar
> relationship to the undelegated *Sales Marketing* activity thus
> providing insight into the performance dimension of the department.

> Keep in mind that the three dimensions have a triadic, not a

CHART 1 THE THREE COMPANY DIMENSIONS

> You are in your Chonburi office. Three weeks have passed since your
> dinner with Sal. Everyone in the company has been briefed on the new
> purchase, on the promotions, on the proposed new positions in the
> company, and on the general reasons behind these decisions.
>
> Perse has been busy interviewing prospective new employees for his own
> department, for the job of Operations VP of the new division, and for
> the Sales VP position. There are already applicants that he feels
> would be excellent for both VP positions, but he is still receiving
> applications and he is personally checking references. He has already
> selected several new people for his own department.
>
> He has just come into your office with a proposed organization chart.
> It is in fact a series of charts that elaborate upon one another. He
> has spread them out on a large table beside a row of open windows in
> your second floor office. Birds are chattering in a tree outside,
> sometimes landing on the sill and looking in.
>
> You begin studying Chart 1 first. You scan it quickly. You are
> impressed with his work.
>
> "I like the way that you have laid this out. This chart makes it clear
> that the six domains of activity for the whole company relate in polar
> pairs to provide insight into the three dimensions. Excellent."
>
> "One must keep in mind that the three dimensions constitute a triadic

>
> "A good point. There is not a linear or hierarchical relationship
> between them."

> "That's fine, Perse. You have also shown how one Personnel Department
> has a polar relationship to two Product activities, one being the
> Operations Department of the new complex, the other being the
> Construction Department of the property development division. And it
> is clear from the way you have drawn them that these two Product
> Departments are delegated at different levels of responsibility. Very
> good."
>
> "I feel that the Construction Manager and the Design Manager may have
> more senior responsibilities than managers within the Operations
> Department. They are responsible for major design decisions and
> capital expenditures, and yet they still work at the supervisory
> level. One can think of them as operating at an executive supervisory
> level."
>
> "Sometimes there are distinctions such as this to be made and fairly
> assessed, to be sure. I notice that you have indicated a difference by
> the way you have sized and arranged the dialog boxes on the chart.
> These two departments are moving toward fourth level delegation."
>
> "I have wondered what will happen if and when the property development
> division grows sufficiently to assume fourth level delegation status.
> There will be a VP, let's call him Development VP, to distinguish him
> from the Operations VP. I assume that the mainstream product activity
> will continue to be construction. Will this new VP be responsible for
> Personnel, Design, Finance, Sales and Marketing activities also?"
>
> You pause for a moment, wondering where Perse is going with his
> question. You thought he understood the answer already. "Of course,
> although all of these activities will not be delegated at the
> supervisory level."
>
> "Then there must be a considerable reorganization when that happens,
> because these activities are, for the most part, currently being
> performed by independent departments of the company as they relate to
> the Construction Department."
>
> "I see what you mean." But you hadn't considered the problem before.
> Suddenly it is clear that this is one way that organizations get into
> trouble as they grow. They don't recognize a need to reshuffle the
> whole organization at a critical stage of expansion. "When a
> Development VP is appointed at the administrative level, then the
> related activities essential for insight into the three dimensions
> must be separated out of their independent departments. They must be
> included within the new Development Department in order for the new VP
> to keep the three dimensions in proper perspective and balance. But a
> portion of these activ-
>
> 138 • *Enlightened Management*

> ities will still remain with their independent departments for the
> company as a whole."
>
> "So that means there would be a Personnel Officer reporting to the new
> Development VP performing a job similar to my old job?"
>
> "Yes. And likewise there would be a Sales Manager, and a Finance
> Manager reporting to the new Development VP. These activities will be
> broadly qualified by policies established company wide by respective
> departments that will still report directly to me."
>
> "You are referring now to such things as national and international
> sales policy and pricing. Local policy and pricing must be reasonably
> consistent, although there may be room for considerable flexibility to
> accommodate local circumstances. Is that the way you see it?"
>
> Perse has a mind like a steel trap. You must watch what you say if you
> don't want to get cornered by your own words. "It is a matter of
> context, yes. For example, the Finance VP is responsible for
> establishing a company wide system of accounts that accurately
> reflects the organization structure. This system must be sufficiently
> flexible to allow the Development Finance Manager or the Operations
> Finance Manager to designate subsidiary accounts to do local costing
> when and if this is locally desired."
>
> "How about the Design Department then? Would it be completely included
> within the Development Division? If it is, there will be no Product
> Development Department for the company as a whole."
>
> A good question. Better throw it back at him. "Why should the whole
> Design Department be included under a new Development VP?"
>
> "I should think because it is concerned with designing new
> developments."
>
> "There is an important distinction to be made here." You think for a
> moment. You know there is a distinction to be made, but you have to
> put it clearly in focus. "We never plunge headlong into detailed
> architectural and engineering design work on any project. Preliminary
> and conceptual design studies *always* come first, complete with
> preliminary estimates and feasibility studies. Several conceptual
> designs may be explored and compared before finally deciding on a
> specific preliminary design. This preliminary design and estimate then
> serves to define the scope of work and the parameters of the final
> design. The final design will include the preparation of detailed
> specifications, detailed design drawings, and the terms and conditions
> of contracts, if any, all of which constitute the construction
> package."
>
> *Chart 1The Three Company Dimensions* • 139
>
> Perse reflects for a moment. He is looking at a group of house mynahs
> that are having an argument in the tree outside. "But preparing the
> final design, the detailed plans, specifications and so on, represents
> the bulk of the work, and yet you say that this should all be
> delegated to the domain of the new Development VP. You are saying that
> just the preliminary studies that define the conceptual nature,
> extent, and budget of a development project properly belong with a
> Design Department for the company as a whole? This is the Product
> Development activity of the whole company then?"
>
> "Exactly. Only in this way can the *potential* of a specific
> development project be assessed with respect to the company's overall
> financial position. The decision to proceed with a project gives
> direction to the whole company and must also reflect company wide
> input from Marketing, Sales, Personnel, and the Development Department
> itself. Doing the heavy slogging of working out the detailed design
> then belongs in the Development Department."
>
> "I see," Perse says, mulling over the ideas. "The Development activity
> for the company as a whole will be smaller but have a broader scope
> than the Development activity within the new Property Development
> Department." Another question is troubling him. "Why would the
> Personnel VP be involved in deciding on whether a specific project
> should proceed?"
>
> "Because the scope of the project may impact the organization
> structure! We may need to grow or acquire new skills. Or the lack of a
> project may require the organization to consolidate and shrink."
>
> Perse is looking at the birds again. They are chasing each other

> decision whether to proceed with a project or not must also assess the
> negative consequences of having too little work on our plate. Either
> too much or too little can create a problem. Interesting."
>
> "Balance is the key word. Insight into the three dimensions must find

>
> "This looks very similar to the way we discussed this department in

> want of better words. Although they don't do supervisory work in the

>
> "Yes, we must be clear about our terms, however we use them. And I
> think I can begin to see some of the polarities breaking out in the
> functions you have listed under the Hotel Manager's supervision. For
> instance, Guest Service, Food & Beverage, Conventions, and
> Entertainment activities are different kinds of *product work.* The
> polar partner is *organization work* done by the
> Reservations/Scheduling activity, thus providing insight into a
> *commitment* dimension. Then Maintenance is a kind of *development
> work* in the context of hotel operation, whereas Purchasing/Stores has
> a *financial* character, requiring maintenance materials and equipment
> to be budgeted for, thus offering insight into a *potential*
> dimension. Reception/Sales includes the task of booking conventions
> and groups of various sorts and collecting payment, so that it is
> clearly *sales work*, while the polar partner of the *performance*
> dimension, *marketing work,* is not delegated. The Hotel Manager thus
> has insight into three dimensions at the functional level. Although

> breaking out as the company grows."[2](#_bookmark10) "It's uncanny how

> where the four kinds of work relate respectively to the direction

> *Idea a Knowledge a Routine a Form.*
>
> In other words:

> *Managerial Work gives form to Idea and direction to Knowledge;
> Administrative Work gives form to Knowledge and direction to Routine;
> Supervisory Work gives form to Routine and direction to behaviour;
> Functional Work gives form to behaviour and direction to a product.*
>
> 146 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> (See Chapter 8, Note 4.)
>
> Observe now that each level of work in turn has four self-similar
> levels. For example a company Managing Director, or President, in the
> course of doing *managerial work,* must translate the product *idea*
> into a communicable *form* through his *knowledge* and behavioral
> *routines*. He doesn't have to physically make the product, but he
> must physically perform in order to communicate the idea through
> speech, written word and gesture. Likewise an Administrative VP must
> translate the communicated *idea* into some plan for its physical
> *formation* through the *knowledge* and *routines* that become
> structured into the infrastructure and facilities developed, and so
> on. Everyone must translate *ideas* into *forms* through *knowledge*
> and *routines* in order to function.
>
> The point here is that as a business organization grows, delegation
> begins at the *Functional* level, then the *Supervisory* level breaks
> out, then the *Administrative* and *Managerial* levels become
> distinct. As an organization grows to five levels, a junior
> *supervisory* level breaks out within the *Functional* level, while
> the *Supervisory* level acquires an *administrative* flavor with a
> focus distinct from the *Administrative* level which now acquires a
> *Managerial* flavor. The horizons of the Managing Director likewise
> expand, yet the nature of his work is still essentially *Managerial*
> in character, but with a more fundamental focus that still underlies
> the direction of the whole business.
>
> Returning now to the hotel chain division of our company, the new
> Division Chief Executive will now have reporting to him a number of
> Hotel Managers, each with expanded responsibilities for the operation
> and maintenance of a hotel with local and regional sales and financial
> responsibilities, similar to the job of the Operations VP before
> expansion. But there will be a centralized Division planning and
> development department with architectural and engineering expertise,
> and likewise centralized personnel, finance, sales, and marketing
> activities, each independently delegated to maintain overall insight
> into the three dimensions at the Division level. These activities will
> assume many of the responsibilities of their counterparts in the
> parent company and connections with the parent organization will
> become more tenuous.
>
> The parent five level organization will still have six delegated
> activities one level down from the President, however, so that there
> will still be a degree of control and direction implicitly given in
> each activity. For example, the Personnel activity for the whole
> company will still be concerned with the structural integrity of the
> organization, according to
>
> *Chart 2 The Operations Department •* 147
>
> the two structural constraints, but the focus will be concentrated on
> the top three levels of the whole organization, including other
> Divisions that may have emerged. There will likewise be a Development
> activity in the parent organization, but the focus will have
> broadened, perhaps into extending the hotel chain internationally, or
> into other avenues of diversification.
>
> Whatever the case, it is a characteristic of the way organizations
> evolve beyond four levels, that they can still be considered as four
> level organizations, from the top down four levels, when it comes to
> the pragmatics of structuring them to maintain insight into the three
> dimensions. For example, in our five level hotel chain the four levels

> may effectively be considered as a functional level within the context
> of the whole company. Having done this, and developed the organization
> accordingly, one can then move down one level into the hotel chain
> organization and consider it as four levels, thus developing the
> organization down *five* levels. The two structural constraints may

>
> Perse turns back to Con. "Anything else?"

>
> "Where does safety come in?"
>
> "Safety is concerned with quality control too, but because human

>
> Con glances again at the chart. "Yes. And it seems that we are saddled

>
> Perse turns to Chart 4, outlining the Design Department under Des. You
> interrupt. "Perhaps it would be good to get Fin in on this dis-
>
> cussion," you say, as you pick up the phone to call him. "After all,
> Finance is the polar partner to the Design Department and he will be
> interested to see how the two departments interface on paper."
>
> Fin arrives shortly, and Perse proceeds.
>
> "I have placed drafting at the top of the list, as the mainstream
> activity of the department, " he says. "Is that correct?"
>
> "My first reaction is to say no." Des scans the chart carefully. "But
> on second thought I think you are right. Drafting does the actual
> planning, that is, committing the design ideas to a final drawing
> form. The design engineers and architects are concerned with the
> development of the ideas themselves, so they are the idea development
> activity as tensionally coupled to the mainstream product activity."
>
> "Then as construction proceeds, you have draftsmen revising drawings
> to show the actual as built condition. I assume that changes are
> frequently made on site to accommodate conditions. Where does this as
> built information come from?"
>
> "Usually from the construction inspectors. It is part of their job to
> make as built sketches of alterations. If there is no inspector, as
> sometimes happens on a very small job, the task falls to the job
> foreman. If there is a major design change, the information may come
> from a design engineer."
>

>
> "Yes. Printing and copying machines are running constantly."
>
> "It is the Drawing Scheduler's job then to monitor all of this

> Design Scheduler who reports directly to you?"
>
> "Keep in mind that a major project may have several hundred drawings,
> and that a number of projects may be on the boards, or these days on

> draftsman does what next. This takes a lot of planning and keeping
> track of. The Chief Draftsman needs this Scheduler to assist him. On
> the other hand, as Design Manager, I have to be concerned with
> scheduling the work of the whole department, which engineers will be
> assigned which projects, which projects are higher priority, which
> portions of certain designs need to be completed first to expedite
> material and equipment purchasing, and so on. These priorities and
> bottlenecks are assessed in weekly meetings with all supervisors in

> Sales Scheduler, so that problem areas are identified in advance."
>
> You interject. "This further exemplifies how departments interface

>
> Fin speaks up. "Don't forget that we also have to schedule the money

>
> "Right," says Des. "A copy of the projected Design Schedule, together

> "Why is it necessary to have two budget estimates, one from design and

>
> 162 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> Des fields the question. "The design estimate is for a whole project.
> The estimated cost is broken down into various material, equipment and
> labor categories. The construction estimate brakes each project down
> into expenditures over time. Between the two of them the Finance
> Department is kept informed both of the total expected expenditures
> for each project, and also when these expenditures are likely to
> occur."
>
> "When we implement the new system of accounts to reflect the
> organization structure, it should facilitate this budgeting and
> reporting process," Fin observes. "In fact the information should be
> on the computer for access whenever anyone wants it."
>
> Des moves on to the next item on the chart, to the architectural
> design task. "Generally speaking, the architects have the first go at
> a new project. In fact the first preliminary sketches may be produced
> before the decision is made to purchase the land. There is an annual
> budget allotment for preliminary studies. Alternative ideas and
> concepts are evaluated together with very rough estimates of costs and
> revenues, best case and worst case scenarios, that sort of thing. Once
> the options are narrowed down, the engineers will have some input,
> from a practical rather than from an aesthetic perspective, providing
> ball park construction estimates and a critical assessment of the
> preliminary architectural designs. Things pleasing to the eye are
> sometimes impractical to build, or there may be special difficulties
> with the site, quicksand and so on. The few options that may survive
> are then reviewed by management for a decision."
>
> "As you know, all six departments have essential input into the
> decision making process on a new project," you interject. You want to

> Des continues. "Once the preliminary design and the purchase of

> The architectural design becomes more focused, providing the

> electrical drawings. The Senior Design Engineer in charge of the
> project, agrees this planned schedule of drawings with the Chief
> Draftsman, and the information begins to flow directly between the

>
> "The focus is on maintaining engineering design standards, as opposed

> on arrival, to make sure it measures up to the standards expected. We
> monitor the strength of concrete coming out of our plant. We take
> random checks on the tensile strength of rebar and structural steel,
> also pipe and some plastics. We test welders and do non-destructive
> testing on welding. We witness tests on major equipment at the
> manufacturer's plant, we check its condition on arrival, and we
> frequently supervise technical points of its installation. We do
> design calculations on temporary construction support structures of
> various kinds, such as trench shoring and scaffolding, to ensure that

> NOTES:

> 1 These ideas concerning the three dimensions, consisting of a triad

> dynamics of the creative process. They derive from a universal
> "System" of organization associated with the cosmic order, which
> unfolds in discrete stages associated with the reconciliation of
> multiplicity to unity. Each successive stage of the System elaborates
> on the stages that precede it, at the same time being transcended and
> subsumed by all of the stages that precede it. This System thus allows
> of infinite elaboration within itself through a natural progression of
> higher Systems that are nevertheless subsumed and transcended by the
> lower Systems. This universal pattern of organization concerns the age
> old questions of the One and the Many, unity and diversity, self and

######## CHAPTER 16

> CHART 5 THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT
>
> The polar partner to Design (idea or product development) is Finance
> (resource capacity to realize idea), thus giving an insight into the
> *potential* dimension. Perse and Fin have gone over the expanded needs
> of the Financial Department as they relate to the six activities, and
> have drafted out Chart 5. Perse turns to it now.
>
> "Your mainstream activity is the Accounting Section," he says to Fin.
> "Accounts Receivable and Payable are straight forward enough. You have
> to bill customers and you have to pay expenses and meet other
> financial obligations. In order to do this efficiently you have to
> schedule short term cash flows and balance the books. All of the
> relevant data must be collected from each department and accounted for
> in a balance sheet and other financial statements. These tasks will no
> doubt become more complicated with the addition of the new hotel
> complex, right?"
>
> "Yes, but not as much as you might think. The capital investment of
> the company and the total number of employees will increase
> dramatically. But much of the increase in daily cash flow will be the
> responsibility of the Finance section within the new Operations
> Department. They will have their own accounts receivable and accounts
> payable activities as they relate to the ongoing daily business of the
> complex, income from hotel customers, rental income, paying
> electricity, purchasing operating supplies, food bills, that sort of
> thing. "
>
> "I see, Perse says. "So in a sense they will be looking after
> financial matters as they relate to the ongoing functional activity of
> the rental complex, much as the Personnel Officer of the department
> will be looking after the functional level of personnel work."
>
> "That's a good way to look at it. There is a clear distinction to be
> made here between functional level activity associated with recurrent
> task cycles of the business, and the supervisory and administrative
> levels of activity behind it." Fin has obviously thought about the

> height="0.18833333333333332in"}design of the facilities and the
> infrastructure to be operated. The supervisory level implicitly gives
> direction in turn to the functional level, by committing the resources
> of labor, facilities and material to specific product cycles. It
> should therefore be clear that the labor, equipment and materials
> employed at the functional level is a tally of that actually committed
> to a set of specific results by the supervisory level. In collecting
> data according to a prescribed system of accounts receivables, paying
> wages, utilities and other services, paying invoices for routine
> materials and equipment and so on the bulk of the accounting legwork
> is done at source, where it is easily checked and verified. I think
> this is good," Fin says confidently.
>
> "So this accumulation of functional activity data reflects the
> supervisory level commitment of resources." Perse pauses to think for
> a moment. "I guess that's to be expected since the reporting activity
> flows countercurrent to the delegation implicit in the hierarchy." You
> are surprised by the grasp that Perse displays of finance.
>
> "I never thought of it that way, but you're right of course.
> Delegation flows down through the hierarchy and reporting flows back
> up."
>
> "So the accounting activity of the Finance Department for the whole
> company differs from that of the Operations Department in that the
> former focuses on the supervisory and administrative levels as opposed
> to the functional level. Does that mean that there should be a split
> in accounting between the Operations Department and the company as a
> whole, according to the type of expense and revenue involved? For
> example, would there be a split in the payroll between supervisory
> people and functional people?"
>
> "In this case I think there should be, yes," Fin replies without
> hesitation. "The Operations VP and the supervisory people reporting
> directly to him should be on a separate payroll administered by the
> Finance Department. There are comparatively few people involved, of
> course, but they are key employees that you are directly concerned
> with as Personnel VP."
>
> "Yes, their salary levels, special training, and so on, will be
> concerns of the Personnel Department."
>
> You add your agreement. You want a degree of managerial input to your
> administrative and senior supervisory people, and at no time should
> you have to go down three levels in the organization. Individual
> functional level people are normally beyond your direct reach as CEO,
> al-
>
> 174 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> though you remain concerned with their collective needs and
> responsibilities.
>
> Fin continues. "There are also analogous costs, such as the
> depreciation of capital facilities, the buildings and major long term
> equipment, that must also be the concern of the Finance Department,
> since these expenditures concern the administration of the whole
> company. These allowances must be assessed and factored into the
> operation of the hotel complex, along with such things as the direct
> costs of financing the operation, general overheads, and the like."
>
> "How about revenues?" Perse asks. "Are all revenues of the department
> generated by the direct operation of the rental complex?"
>
> "No. There are revenues other than direct income that should accrue to
> the credit of the Operations Department. For example, retained
> earnings of the department, the pension fund, and any other
> accumulated funds will be invested by the Finance Department and
> accumulate further profits. The point is that the finance activity
> within the Operations Department will have a good degree of autonomy
> at the functional level, but this must be integrated by the general
> accounting activity of the Finance Department, which generates the
> relevant financial statements and interfaces with the other five
> activities within the Finance Department."
>
> "And the Accounting polar partner activity, facilitating insight into
> the *commitment* dimension of the Finance Department, is the Account
> Systems activity." Perse looks at Chart 5 again. "This Account Systems
> activity provides an operating context for the Accounting activity
> through establishing a system of accounts that reflects the
> organization structure, as well as the requirements stipulated by
> generally accepted accounting practices and governmental regulations."
>
> "That's right," says Fin. "Then computer programs must be written to
> allow for the random assimilation of the information in whatever
> format is demanded by any department. For example, material and
> equipment identification is traditionally a thorny problem. There are
> many thousands of items of material, each distinct item having a
> description accompanied by an identifying number. But sometimes the
> same material is used by different departments for different purposes,
> a water valve, for example. Sometimes it's used for maintenance, or
> operations, or a development project, or a certain client's building,
> or a capital addition. So the identifying numbers should also have
> certain digits to designate the department, the end use, and the
> status. By status I mean whether
>
> *Chart 5 The Finance Department •* 175

> ordered, in stock, issued, or installed. Then all material can be
> automatically tallied for whatever purpose, for instance costing the
> erection of a client's factory, or general maintenance, or determining
> inventories, or checking on materials received and outstanding for an
> impending project. Likewise manpower, overheads, construction
> equipment and so on, must first be identified then qualified three
> ways: with a source department, a status, and an end use."
>
> "I can see that all of this information can also be readily
> assimilated to determine a pattern of cash flow associated with
> various projects scheduled, with projected sales and income, and with
> general operations and maintenance. This cash flow planning will
> facilitate the cash scheduling of the Accounting activity and also
> allow the Finance activity of the Finance Department to optimize
> investment opportunities."
>
> "That's true," Fin confirms.
>
> You are impressed at the way he and Perse work together. These two men
> have had the best opportunity to reflect on the six activities and
> three dimensions of a company, and it is already paying off. A month
> ago there would have been no possible way for them to discuss these
> subjects in a mutually accepted context of understanding. They
> continue, oblivious to the racket going on in the tree outside. House
> mynahs are a rowdy lot.
>
> "There is also the Budgeting activity to consider when planning cash
> flows," Fin adds, "because the *potential* dimension between the
> Finance and Budgeting activities concerns the future. Budgeting is a
> product development activity funded by the resources of Finance,
> within the Finance Department. The current budget is monitored
> according to schedules provided by all departments, and short term
> cash flows must be accommodated in step with this information, as
> continually revised and updated. The chart indicates that the
> assimilation of the next annual budget provides a one year lead time

>
> 176 • *Enlightened Management*

> "Generally speaking, yes," Fin confirms. "On the property development
> side of the company, we must also remember that many of our projects
> take several years to mature. In the meantime there may be huge
> capital outlays involved, adding to our assets, of course, but with
> little in the way of receivables from sales. In reality these assets

> corresponds to a sales function. Together with its marketing polar

> *performance* dimension of the Finance Department. Hopefully the
> Fiscal Research activity would provide direction about the future

>
> "True enough," Fin says, "but it is virtually impossible to predict
> social and political upheavals in the world today. Such things as a
> revolution in China or another Gulf War can have devastating effects.
> A degree of conservatism is advised in assessing patterns of profit
> distribution, because the earnings indicted in the company's financial
> statements assume that reasonably normal business conditions will
> continue to prevail."
>
> "But when you are assessing how much dividend to declare on

>
> "Yes, but so do you when budgeting how much of our profits should be

>

>
> "Most companies are committed to continued growth and

> growth."
>
> "Without limit?" Perse is unaware of the concerns Fin voiced to you
> previously.
>
> "Without consciously recognizing a limit to growth," you interject.
> "The limits to growth are the limitations of size alone. Organizations
> become so large that they lose contact with themselves. The three
> dimensions stagger out of balance. The organization structure becomes
> so unwieldy that the *commitment* dimension falters badly. When
> organizations lose employee commitment, product quality falls while
> costs increase. This soon tells in sales and the *performance*
> dimension. Profits turn to losses and the company's *potential*
> dimension presents a bleak outlook that may eventually result in the
> death of the organization."
>
> "So then let us suppose that we improve working conditions and
> employee benefits to the point where we are able to attract and keep
> the best possible staff." When Perse gets onto something he doesn't
> let go easily. "This may very well improve efficiency to the point
> where our operating costs are lower than our competition despite
> higher salaries, thus generating comparatively higher profits. Reduced
> product cost and improved quality will likewise generate more sales
> and comparatively higher profits yet again. The occupancy rates in our
> hotel may become much higher than average, for example. So this
> problem of a surplus profit may not be so easy to dispense with,
> except through growth. We could always give it all away to the
> stockholder, of course, but one is hard pressed to understand why we
> should, beyond a reasonably attractive return on investment. We may
> thus be stuck between one of two options, mindless growth, or
> over-inflated stock."
>
> "If things turn out so rosy as the picture you paint, then perhaps we
> should put something back into the system," you suggest.
>
> "Into what system?" Con asks. He and Des have been listening with

>
> "Into the socio-economic system that we are dependent upon. Into the

>
> "If it comes to that, yes. Why not? Everyone talks about a better

>
> "There is another problem to be considered as well in this question of
> profit distribution" Fin interjects. "We must be careful that a fund
> of retained earnings for a rainy day does not get out of hand. If it
> becomes disproportionate in relation to dividends paid and the market

>
> "You mean someone might buy up our stock because it is undervalued?"

>
> "Exactly. It's the healthiest companies that make the best targets.

> "We'll get to that later, Sal. What can you tell us about your Sales

>
> Sal shrugs. "Mostly advertising. A lot of newspaper adds and radio,

> give away some TV sets to prospective home buyers. We also have a

> prices and financing arrangements on purchasing homes. We've got to
> reach a lot of people to sell over a thousand housing and condo units
> a year. But it looks to me from your chart that all of these
> activities are going to be duplicated by an international sales
> program. It seems to me to be quite a waste."
>
> "We've discussed this before, Sal," you interject. "The main focus

> construction and sale of every unit in every project."
>
> *Chart 6 The Sales Department •* 185

> "So then the international scheduler will be duplicating the work of

>
> "They will both have access to the same computerized information. They

>
> "So then the international scheduler will also be duplicating the work

>
> "On the contrary Sal, international efforts will complement the
> regional sales focus of the Operations Department. The various
> department schedulers provide a means to interface and integrate these
> independently focused efforts."
>
> "What will international sales people be doing then?"
>
> "They will be contacting businesses that may want to lease or buy
> premises in Thailand. In order to do that, foreign companies must form

>
> "I see," says Sal. He is unimpressed but does acknowledge the
> international function. "The same general kinds of activities are

>
> Mark II shakes his head. "Our studies confirm that it must go

>
> "You're quite right, Sir. There is going to be a lot of chaos at the

>
> "What are your first priorities then?"
>
> "The most urgent priority is hiring the key people in the new
> organization structure, the two new VP's of course, but also the key
> supervisory levels in the new commercial complex. We need these

>
> "Systems? What systems? I don't understand."
>
> "The systems of formal communications involved in running the
> business. We have to invent a whole new system of forms and paperwork

> 1 See Chapter 8, pages 63 and 72, for a discussion of the two
> structural constraints. The first structural constraint requires that
> each of the six regions always be delegated separately. The second
> structural constraint requires delegation to take place in four
> levels, beginning at the functional level, then the supervisory level,
> then the administrative level, as the organization warrants it, in
> accordance with the universal hierarchy. Delegation at the managerial
> level does not take place until a five level company is reached.
>
> 2 There are corollaries to the two structural constraints. For
> example, the universal hierarchy *Idea a Knowledge a Routine a Form*
> defines four successive active processes involved in any creative
> endeavor. But since *ideation* itself is a creative process, a
> homologue of the same hierarchy is implicated in the process of giving
> form to *idea*. There are four self-similar levels within the idea
> level. Likewise there is a homologue of the same hierarchy implicated
> in giving form to *knowledge*, also to *routine*, and even to *form*
> itself. In fact a homologue of the hierarchy becomes manifest first in
> the case of *form*. which is why we see sub levels breaking out first
> at the *functional* level of work, as we discussed previously in
> Chapter 13, Note 2. There is also a structural reason for this that
> can be seen in how the "System" proliferates, but it is beyond our
> present scope. It may be said that the levels within levels are
> self-similar, or that there is an isomorphy to the structure of
> experience.
>
> Another related corollary concerns the way the levels are delegated in
> each of the six activities. For example the President may delegate the
> Marketing activity at the Supervisory Level, even though the
> Functional level is not fully developed and a Functional level
> supervisor might do the job that is technically required. But if

> shoulders, while still leaving him with insight into the three
> dimensions and in control of the company's overall direction. This
> flexible privilege of over delegating a job in special circumstances
> does not extend to two levels, however. If the President delegated the
> Marketing activity at the Administrative level, he would lose insight

> Persist ignores him. "Perhaps you could give me an example, Oper."

> Oper thinks for a minute. "Let's say that I want the hotel to open a

>
> Persist has no hesitation. "The thing that I want to stress here is

> might organize it, consistent with the two structural constraints, and
> let you take your pick."
>
> "Alternative ways?" Oper looks skeptical. "Can you give me an

>
> "For instance, you might not have considered that there may be

>
> "And the Personnel Officer reporting to me would do the hiring?" "Yes,

>
> "With input from the relevant supervisors in your department, yes. The

> something a little different."
>
> "Then what's this talk I hear about people writing their own job
> descriptions?"
>
> "Yeah. What about that?" Sal chuckles. "I've got some great ideas for
> my job." No one else is amused. His smirk fades.
>
> Perse fields the question. "The idea obviously wasn't intended to give
> people the freedom to independently determine their jobs. The point is
> we already have a large organization consisting of hundreds of people,
> and it would be a valuable training aid in the new organizational
> concept to have them write there own job descriptions from the
> organization charts. It is relatively simple, as you have seen. It
> would acquaint everyone with the organizational principles involved,
> and it would help Persist get the job done. The process would be
> monitored for consistency, of course."
>
> "We might even learn something from the exercise," Persist adds. "But
> in drafting out a new organization from scratch this is hardly
> possible. Once people are in their jobs for a short while we can ask

> as a training exercise, to familiarize them with how the organization
> works." Persist pauses for a moment, looking at Oper. "Is your main

>
> "Perhaps." Oper replies slowly, tentatively. "I can see that you have

> Persist smiles and nods.

######## CHAPTER 21

> COMMON ACCORD AND RESONANCE
>
> As the meeting wound up there was some interesting conversation under
> way. You decided to treat everyone to lunch so that it might continue.
> You are now seated around a large table in a Chinese restaurant and
> everyone is having suki yaki. The Chinese call it hwo koah, meaning
> fire pot.
>
> You throw the question that has been playing in your mind open to the
> group. "Why is mutual accord possible, and why is it so intimately
> associated with insight into three dimensions?" you ask, while dipping
> some shrimps and vegetables into the boiling water for cooking.
> Electrically heated cooking pots have been placed on the tables for
> the purpose. Everyone has joined in. You are steering the conversation
> a bit, but it was headed in this direction anyway, thanks to Sal's
> rather overbearing opposition to anything that suggests that he must
> be in agreement. He has a certain nuisance value in situations like
> this.
>
> "I suppose, in the end, that it's just a matter of having to get along
> and get on with the job," says Mark II. "Everyone has to make certain
> compromises in life. It only stands to reason that we all can't have
> everything that we want."
>
> "But why should there be three dimensions involved? Why is mutual
> accord in a business a matter of coming to terms with three polar
> relationships? Why is this an organizational imperative? There is no
> compromise here. Is this just an accident of evolution? Or is there
> some compelling reason that this must be so?" You are faced with a
> round of puzzled looks. All but Sal, who is admiring the silk wall
> hangings adorning the red walls.
>
> "There is more to this matter of mutual accord than first meets the
> eye," Perse ventures. "Structuring an organization concerns the
> structuring of human experience. It concerns how we ourselves have
> been structured to integrate experience, because our organizations are
> an extension of how each of us functions as individuals."
>
> 220 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> Oper looks at him, a little shocked. "Are you saying that a business
> organization should work like a single human being? How is that
> possible? Even if we reach a common accord, we are not all of one
> mind."
>
> "Are you sure that a human being is of one mind?"
>
> "That's the common belief. Well, isn't it?" He looks at Perse as if it
> must be so.
>
> Perse looks to his assistant. "Persist has a lot of background in
> clinical psychology and is probably better qualified to answer the
> question. I know she has some thoughts on this. Would you mind,
> Persist?"
>
> Persist sifts through some papers in a file in front of her, then
> thinks better of it and closes the file. "I'll try. I'm not sure this
> all comes from a psychology background. A lot of things started coming
> together for me when I came here to work. Perhaps I'm more indebted to
> the intuition of our President. When I made contact with these
> organizational principles, I began to make sense of important
> fundamental studies that I hadn't understood the full significance of
> before. I hadn't fully grasped the fact that I was trying to fathom
> how experience is organized. I thought there were physical causes for
> experience, like there may be physical causes for a car accident. It
> has finally dawned upon me that there is a great deal of psychological
> evidence in support of there being three dimensions to the integration
> of human experience."
>
> "So then you mean that the integration of human experience is
> analogous to the way that business organizations integrate
> experience?" Oper is still very puzzled. He is ignoring the food.
>
> "Yes," says Persist, pausing to finish a mouthful. "Let me elaborate a
> little. Early histological studies on the structure of the human brain
> established that the limb, or extremities of the cerebral hemispheres,
> that are folded in around the brain stem, are similar in structure to
> the brains of the reptiles and lower mammals.[1](#_bookmark16) Later
> it was noticed that these primitive brains in man correspond to the
> brains of the reptile and the lower mammal in our evolutionary
> history. To put it more concretely, the brains of the crocodile and
> the horse are represented in the human brain, and they are intimately
> associated with the autonomic nervous system which fuels our emotions.
> This functionally integrated *limbic system*, as it is called, is very
> ancient, going back several hundred millions of years to the
> development of the reptiles. This was modified by the advent of the
> lower mammals, but then, overlying these primitive brains, came the
> explosive development of the cerebral hemispheres associated with
> intelligence in the higher mammals and especially in man. This new
> brain is
>
> *Common Accord and Resonance •* 221

> not colored in its function with emotional experience, relating more
> directly to external inputs.
>
> The interesting thing is that there seems to be no direct biological
> controls by this huge new intellectual brain over the primitive
> emotional brain, yet they are constrained to live in the same house
> together. You might say that we have acquired the intellectual
> capacity to build atomic bombs and send rockets to the moon, but it is
> harnessed to the emotional capacity of a crocodile and a
> horse."[2](#_bookmark15)
>
> For a moment everyone looks at Persist, as her words sink in. Even
> Sal's eyes come unglued from the wall hangings. Then he laughs his
> loudest equestrian laugh. Des, Fin, the Marks and Con look a little
> stunned. Oper slaps the table. "What are you saying? That we think
> like a human and feel like a crocodile?"
>
> "At first sight this assessment seems to be in fair agreement with
> humanity's social failings, don't you think Oper? Our history of
> violence and genocidal practices for thousands of years leaves little
> to be proud of. Our intellectual capabilities have a strong tendency
> to become subverted to the service of our basest animal desires."
>
> Oper's eyes are riveted on Persist. "You say at first sight. Is there
> another way to see it?"
>
> "There's just more to the story. About thirty years ago there was some
> important research carried out on epileptic patients who had undergone
> surgical section of the corpus callosum."[3](#_bookmark15)
>
> "The corpus what? Can you use simpler language?"
>
> "Sorry. It's just a huge nerve bundle that interconnects the right and
> left halves of the cerebral hemispheres. It was known from animal
> experiments that no obvious change was to be expected in the patients'
> behaviour if this was cut in two, except that their severe epileptic
> conditions should be markedly improved."
>
> "Why is that? Has this corpus whatever something to do with epilepsy?"
>
> "Not directly. It was just hoped that the focus of epileptic seizures
> would be unable to transmit throughout the brain if the corpus
> callosum was severed."
>
> "So they actually cut the brain in two pieces on a hope?"
>
> "It may sound a little drastic, but there was sound evidence that it
> would likely do more good than harm. This proved to be the case,
> however some curious results became apparent from careful testing. A
> split screen was set up, such that pictures could be flashed onto
> either half of the screen from behind. With the patient looking at the
> center of the
>
> 222 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> screen, a picture flashed on the left screen for a tenth of a second
> would only register on the right brain, and vice versa."
>
> "You mean each eye saw one half of the screen?" Oper asks, all ears,
> still ignoring his food.
>
> "Not quite. The left half of each eye saw the left screen and the left
> halves of both eyes project to the right hemisphere, and vice versa."
>
> "So what happened?"
>
> "When a picture of an object, say a pen, was flashed on the left
> screen, and the person was asked what they saw, they couldn't answer
> correctly. They might say they didn't see anything, or just a flash of
> light. But then when they were asked to pick out the object by touch,
> from one of a number of articles behind the screen, the left hand
> could do it correctly. The left hand is connected to the right brain,
> and the right brain obviously saw what was flashed on the screen. But
> it could not answer verbally because it had no ability to speak. It
> could not utter one word. However, if the picture was flashed on the
> right screen, the left hand could not identify the article, as before.
> But then if the person was asked what it was, they would immediately
> say it was a pen. The left brain saw and it had control of speech, but
> not control of the left hand."
>
> "What do you mean? Are you saying that because these people had split
> brains that they had two minds?" Oper is looking confused. So are you.
> You have heard all the talk about right and left brain thinking, but
> you hadn't realized that these split brain experiments were so

>
> "Under normal conditions both sides of their brains are exposed to

> separate memory track."
>
> Oper shakes his head slowly. "But that means that each hemisphere
> functions separately all of the time. It is just that usually the
> split brains use the same input. Are these people different? From us,

>
> Persist finishes up her beef and noodles. "No. We are all similar in

> Des puts down his chop sticks, examines the drawing carefully and

> "Where does that leave me?" Oper says. "What about operating a hotel

>
> "Operation and Construction are represented as parallel activities in

>
> 234 • *Enlightened Management*
>
> "I didn't say that, exactly. I did indicate that a transcending

> **Introduction:**
>
> We do not have to be financial or economic experts to know that
> something fundamental is wrong with the global financial system. The
> global financial meltdown in 2008 that impoverished most of the world
> and required government bailouts of the financial institutions that
> created the problem was ample evidence of that. It was triggered by
> bankers and financial institutions that were packaging Mortgage Backed
> Securities (MBS) and re-packaging them with toxic sub-prime mortgages
> as Derivatives, Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), CDO's of
> CDO's, and synthetic CDO's. The many variations of these devices
> allowed banks and hedge funds to resell their credit risk in a pool of
> arbitrarily created financial instruments that can be highly
> leveraged. Their risk is swapped for a small payment to other
> investors who are willing to assume it. One did not even have to be a
> party to the debt obligation to trade in it. Just before the crash
> Credit Default Swaps totaled over 62 trillion dollars. This compares
> with an estimated Gross Domestic Product of the USA in 2016 of 18
> trillion dollars.
>
> The rating agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poors, and Fitch were
> knowingly complicit in the financial collapse which facilitated the
> widespread global sale of risky investments. They continued to give
> AAA and AA ratings to unregulated financial instruments that consisted
> of up to 80% or so of sub-prime mortgages even after large scale
> mortgage defaults had begun with the housing market collapse.
> Refinancing was widely advertised with no money down, low adjustable
> rate mortgages, and bad credit acceptable. In some cases mortgages
> were offered at more than the value of the home providing people with
> extra cash in anticipation of rising prices that never materialized
> when the crash came. The real value of the properties was ignored. The
> emphasis was on unrestricted sales for sales commissions and executive
> bonuses. Under these conditions people could buy a home for less than
> the cost of paying rent, so they had nothing to lose. When interest
> rates rose they could no longer afford the payments and large scale
> mortgage defaults occurred. Six million people in the USA lost their
> homes.
>
> Many banks, and large corporations including the insurance giant AIG
> and car manufacturers required huge government bailouts at taxpayer
> expense, even while the CEOs of these organizations received
> multimillion dollar bonuses, often through stock perks and other
> methods of circumventing legal restrictions on bonuses associated with
> the bailouts that officially totaled 700 billion dollars and was
> unofficially open ended. That is officially 2,000 dollars for every
> man woman and child in the USA. The essence of the problem distills to
> an engrained belief in short term profits as the primary engine of
> business. If it is good for business then it must be good for the
> captains of business, right? The promise of immediate profit attracts
> the best executives, right? Short term greed was the prevailing

> responsibility to the cultures in which businesses function has been
> ignored. There is no place for it in the short term bottom line. An

> circumstances they were rewarded for criminal actions that brought
> about failure of the global financial system. No one was prosecuted.
> The mentality has gained propriety in business circles.

> **Profit as the Goal of a Business:**
>
> No business organization makes a profit. A business can only make a
> product or service. Profit is not a goal of business. This
> indoctrinated belief is a misuse of language. Business organizations
> *earn* a

> profit as a *consequence* of making a contribution of value to the

> market need. The creative response to a perceived need is the goal
> that directs the company's activities. Profit as a goal in itself is
> meaningless. If the creative effort is a failure no profit results and
> the corporation fails.
>
> Moreover the accumulation of corporate wealth as an end in itself is
> meaningless. Wealth must be invested in some constructive way to have
> meaning. There has been a traditional belief in a capitalist economy
> that profit should rightly accrue to the stockholder who finances the
> creative effort of the corporation. The stockholders are regarded as
> the capitalists. In corporations that trade on the stock market the
> stockholders are generally anonymous. Senior corporate executives that
> take credit for the profitable stance of the company are reluctant to
> give it all way to anonymous stockholders. It is contrary to the
> prevailing mentality of profit as a goal to give money away to
> strangers. Instead they milk it for exorbitant executive pay and
> bonuses. The accumulated remainder they attempt to manipulate into
> more profit and stock market bonanzas through corporate takeovers,
> mergers, and hostile buyouts to dismember and sell off the victim
> corporation's assets. Leaders of large corporations are skilled at
> this kind of endeavor to maximize short term profit.
>
> The business schools are turning out professional managers that are
> trained at fiscal manipulation as a management style associated with
> leadership. There is a mindset involved that brings together diverse
> elements for the implicit purpose of personal material success by
> maximizing corporate financial success in the competitive context of
> the market place. It is not necessary for the executive managers to
> have a practical insight into the creative dynamics of the specific
> organizations they are entrusted with. Sections of the organization
> tend to become assessed in terms of their fiscal relationship to the
> corporate balance sheet. They become organized into cost and profit
> centers with the attendant purpose of trimming costs in favor of
> immediate profits accordingly. This financial perspective lacks
> insight into organizational problems that underlie symptoms. It
> disregards interests of employees and customers and it is irrelevant
> to the long term sustainable interests of the stockholder. Although
> there are exceptions the core focus of business schools is
> predominantly on finance despite peripheral courses on social
> responsibility in that context. Financial orientation of professional
> managers on general business practices cannot do justice to managing

>
> **Profit Motive and the Casino Syndrome:**
>
> The goal of short term profit carries with it risk in financial
> markets including the stock market. Fundamentals tend to take second
> place to speculative profits. The computer has greatly facilitated the
> use of programs to automate selling and buying selected stocks
> according to market trends independently of fundamentals. Buying and
> selling on minor fluctuations over periods as short as minutes becomes
> possible. The market can be manipulated to that end. Speculative
> capital gains attract investors looking for large short term gains in
> preference to modest dividends. The stock market together with the
> great variety of contrived financial instruments, many of which trade
> over the counter without regulation, generally focuses on speculative
> profit and speculative risk management. This accentuates the role of
> gambling in financial markets of all kinds. A classic example is the
> collapse of Barings Bank, one of the most respectable in the UK with
> 233 years of history, as a result of speculative trading in futures
> derivatives entrusted to their young employee Nick Leeson.
>
> One can gamble on equities, foreign exchange, debt instruments of many
> kinds, crop failures, even on the weather and the price of fuel or
> rice. Political events, wars, terrorist activities, hurricanes,
> earthquakes, news releases, insider trading, and more can all affect
> market fluctuations and upset stability in financial markets to the
> detriment of the average person. While those who follow markets

>
> **The Distribution of Profit for Sustainable Advantage:**
>
> Some people will say that profit is a goal because it is essential to
> a corporation's survival. So are employees, customers and
> shareholders. The capitalist might say that the shareholder is
> entitled to all the profit because they fund the operation of the
> company. A labor union may argue that workers create the profit
> through their labor and they are entitled to a share. The customer can
> only realize a share in the company's profit if it is passed on in
> lower product prices or increased product value as compared to
> competitive products available in the market place. There are always
> these three primary interest groups, Shareholders, Employees and
> Customers. The private interests of each of them lie outside the
> company's creative efforts and yet each profits from it as a
> consequence of the company's success.
>
> A free market economy does not mean it must be a capitalist economy.
> All it means is that any company is free to enter the market to offer
> its products or services for sale. This need not be done to maximize
> short term profits. In fact the evidence is painfully clear that greed
> is not a sound business strategy. No one works to enrich another at
> their own expense. Employee commitment to their job is lost. Shoddy
> products at inflated prices ultimately result in loss of customer
> commitment and market share. Higher profits may attract shareholder
> investment in the short term but it will not be sustainable.
> Investment in corporate infrastructure is a long term undertaking that
> takes years to establish and can take years to deteriorate through
> neglect to exaggerate short term profit.
>
> The sustainable interests of a business are best served by the
> equitable distribution of profit between shareholder, employee, and
> customer, after a suitable reserve to cover product development,
> infrastructure renewal and market contingencies. The shareholder is
> assured of a fair return on investment, the employee is assured of
> improved pay and benefits, and the customer is assured of product
> value at reduced price. This assures the commitment of all three
> interest groups to the success of the company, it enhances the quality
> of life for everyone, and it prevents the erosion of the consumer
> base. Beyond this profit has no constructive meaning. It is all
> reinvested in the sustainable success of the company for the benefit
> of all.
>
> **The Three Company Dimensions:**
>
> There are three internal activities that creatively relate to the
> three external interest groups. The three polar relationships between
> them constitute three company dimensions.
>
> Product Development has a polar relationship to Financial Resources. A
> new Product Idea is sterile without the Financial Resources to develop
> it and Financial Resources are sterile without a Product Idea to
> develop. This is the ***Potential Dimension*** of a company. It
> relates to the stockholder.
>
> Product Sales have a polar relationship to the assessment of market
> need which is properly an independent Marketing function that must be
> separately delegated in companies large enough to warrant delegation.
> Marketing is not Sales. It is the long term vision of the company's
> direction. It involves the assessment of market needs and trends and
> the capacity of the company to meet those needs through possible
> development of new product lines or the phasing out of others. This is
> the ***Performance Dimension*** of a company. It relates to the
> customer.

3

> Product Production has a polar relationship to the Organization
> Structure. If something is wrong with Production either something is
> wrong with how the Organization is structured or with how it is
> staffed. For example purchasing is sometimes included under Finance
> because they pay the bills which means that Production does not have
> control of the material resources needed to achieve its results. Or
> there may be insufficient screening or job training to ensure
> competent employees at all levels. It is the job of the Personnel or
> Human Resources Department to ensure proper Organization Structure and
> as well as competent Staffing. This is the ***Commitment Dimension***
> of a company. It relates to the employee.
>
> The Human Resources Department might better be called the Organization
> Department because it must ensure separate delegation of the six
> company domains that relate in polar pairs in order to ensure
> transparent insight into the three dimensions. This is just as
> important as having competent staff. If the structure is wrong the
> company will function blind and may face failure despite having
> competent staff. A classic example is the global financial collapse of
> 2008. There was no genuine Marketing Department in the financial
> institutions that created the problem. Marketing was interpreted as
> creating a market for selling derivatives and other financial
> instruments for short term profit. The banks and related institutions
> had no long term vision of genuine responsibility to market needs.
> They created false markets.
>
> **Three Company Dimensions and Our Three Brains:**
>
> It is an established scientific fact that we have three distinct
> brains that function differently and that seek a mutually sustainable
> balance. Although this fact is not fully recognized in the scientific
> community the empirical evidence is firmly established.
>
> In the latter half of the twentieth century Dr. Paul MacLean showed
> that the ancient limbic lobe of the cerebral brain is intimately
> associated with our autonomic nervous system which constitutes our
> emotional apparatus. The new part of our cerebral brain to which we
> owe our intellectual capacity has no direct biological controls over
> our emotions which are rooted in our evolutionary ancestry.
>
> They must live in the same house together and often they do not get
> along.
>
> In the late 1960s Dr. Roger Sperry devised a method of testing split
> brain patients who had had the hemispheres of their new brain
> surgically separated for the treatment of severe epilepsy. He was able
> to show only the left hemisphere in right added people can speak and
> that it is thus related to formulating explicit behaviour. The mute
> right hemisphere excels at spatial and temporal integration. It
> intuitively integrates meaning as a whole.
>
> In other words we employ left hemisphere language to relate to the
> linear flux of social circumstance, while our right brain focuses on
> mute intuitive ideas that timelessly integrate experience holistically
> according to our personal history. Both hemispheres are fueled by
> emotional energy patterns that anchor us to our evolutionary roots.
>
> We can thus see in this triad of relationships three personal
> dimensions that correspond to the three company dimensions. Our left
> brain focuses on the Production of language and behaviour in relation
> to our Social Organization. It is our ***Commitment Dimension***. Our
> right brain focuses on Idea Development in relation to our timeless
> Resource Capacity of memory. It is our ***Potential Dimension***. Our
> emotional limbic brain focuses on balance between our Behavioral
> Performance as it relates to emotionally Perceived Needs. This polar
> balance is our ***Performance Dimension***.

> It is thus apparent that business organization structure is properly a

> experience as human beings. If a business is properly structured its
> creative dynamics become transparent to all participants. Everyone can

> whole. Implicitly knowing one's worth is a powerful incentive.
>
> **Delegation in Four Levels:**
>
> Separate delegation of the six domains is essential to maintaining
> insight into the three polar dimensions. There is a degree of
> flexibility allowed associated with parallel delegation of some
> domains while maintaining the three polar relationships. Delegation
> also follows in four distinct levels which can begin to repeat in some
> domains of very large companies.
>
> Task cycles are associated with a functional level of work and
> delegation always proceeds first at this level. There may also be
> sublevels within it, such as a general foreman in the Production
> domain, area foremen reporting to him, and crew foremen reporting to
> area foremen, but they are all concerned with task cycles. Task cycles
> are concerned with the final ***Form*** of the domain product.
>
> They may be the actual act of selling, of attending to accounts
> payable, of screening new employees, and so on in each domain.
>
> Product cycles are associated with what will be called Supervisory
> work. It is concerned with scheduling resources of labor,
> infrastructure and equipment, and material to the creation of specific
> products. In a factory this may involve scheduling certain functional
> teams, complements of equipment and essential materials needed to
> produce certain products. In the Sales domain this may involve
> committing sales teams to regional or technically diverse product
> areas, together with the equipment, advertising and equipment
> required. The accounting domain may be more centralized and the
> supervisory level involves organizing people into accounts receivable,
> accounts payable, budgeting finance requirements, scheduling
> disbursements associated with operational needs and so on. Supervisory
> work in the HR or organization domain may involve establishing job
> descriptions and pay scales, organization analysis, training, public
> relations, union negotiations and grievances. Marketing may involve
> organizing surveys of competitor operations and market trends,
> assessment of existing and projected corporate capacities in various
> market segments and so on. Product development may involve commitment
> to new technologies, specialized research and development equipment
> and similar themes. Product cycles concern creative ***Routines***
> essential to directing functional Task Cycles*.*
>
> Infrastructure cycles are associated with what will be called
> Administrative work. This involves the acquisition and technical
> development of operational facilities and related methods including
> budget assimilation and creating systems of monitoring reports and
> feedback. It may involve land purchases, new factories, equipment
> replacements, upgrading existing facilities, extending sales to
> international markets, decentralizing production into distinct product
> segments with associated decentralized accounting, integrating and
> rationalizing pay scales over the whole organization, establishing
> pension plans and health benefits. Some issues such as outsourcing may
> conflict with commitments to the domestic culture and some related
> issues may require government regulation, tariff protection, and
> international agreements. Also involved are conformance to minimum
> industry standards.

> Infrastructure cycles concern the implementation of technical

> Managerial work is done by the CEO or Managing Director. This one
> person is the embodiment of the integrating company ***Idea***. This

> creative balance. To do this the six domains must be separately
> delegated in order to maintain polar insight into the three
> dimensions.
>
> **Four Levels generate the three Polar Dimensions:**
>
> The four levels are a universal hierarchy that generates System 4 of
> the Cosmic Order. It is always present in human behaviour as follows:
>
> ***Idea*** gives direction to Knowledge *(Managerial) **Knowledge
> ***gives direction to Routines *(Administrative) **Routines ***give
> direction Form *(Supervisory)*
>
> ***Form*** gives direction to physical behaviour *(Functional)*
>
> ***Idea →Knowledge →Routines →Form***
>
> Each level in the Primary Universal Hierarchy is an active interface
> that relates in steps from inside to outside. This is one of nine
> possible ways called Terms that four active interfaces can mutually
> relate to one another with respect to a common inside and outside. The
> nine Terms are generated by five Sets of active interface processes
> that interact. One is a Primary Universal Set with a transform
> sequence that coheres with that of a Secondary Universal Set.
>
> The other three are Particular Sets that transform through a six Step
> sequence of Terms one Step apart. For example the Primary Universal

> **Nations are Collective Individuals:**
>
> There is belief that nations are like corporations and should be
> operated like a business. While all nations are perceived to
> participate in a global economy a nation does not exist for the
> purpose of making a contribution in the form of products and services
> to a global market place. National and international corporations may
> operate this way but nations have distinct borders that determine an
> individual's national identity. Nations themselves do not produce
> products other than people who live together in a socially organized
> context. In this respect they are like collective individuals.
>
> The commitment dimension of a nation does not relate to creating
> products and services to be sold for profit in any market place. There
> are powerful moral and spiritual convictions about appropriate
> Behaviour that are deeply rooted in a nation's history and that have a
> polar relationship to its Social Organization. This is a nation's
> ***Commitment Dimension***. It is historically established just as the
> character of each of us is historically established. A nation has an
> archetypal pattern that tends to be consistent with the general
> character of its citizens within the constraints of accepted law and
> order.
>
> The potential dimension of a nation does not concern its fiscal
> resources in the way that a corporation's potential relates to its
> financial capacity to respond with products to perceived market needs.
> People are the primary resource of every nation, not finance. It is

> back to the foundations of religion, social reforms, habeas corpus,
> schools, universities, health care, our intuitive perception of our

>
> This creates the character of a nation's population. This polar

>
> The performance dimension concerns our emotionally perceived feelings

S.  taxpayers pay \$431.1 billion annually, or 30 percent of total
    income taxes collected, just to comply with and administer the U.S.
    income tax system. (According to the IRS, total gross individual
    income tax collections in 2008 were \$1.4 trillion.2) This cost
    estimate includes:

    -   Approximately \$31.5 billion in direct outlays (e.g. paying a
        professional tax preparer such as H&R Block or purchasing tax
        soft ware) (2010 data).

    -   Total IRS administrative costs of \$12.4 billion (2010 data).

    -   The Taxpayer Advocacy Service of the IRS estimates that
        individuals and businesses also spent 6.1 billion hours
        complying with the filing requirements of the U.S. income tax
        code. We estimate the dollar value or cost of these hours to be
        \$377.9 billion as of 2008. The 6.1 billion hours number was
        estimated by multiplying the number of copies of each form filed
        in tax year 2008 by the average amount of time the IRS estimated
        it took to complete the form.

    -   Individuals spent 3.16 billion hours complying with the income
        tax code, which weighted by time spent by income group, costs
        the U.S. economy \$216.2 billion annually.

    -   Businesses spent 2.94 billion complying with the business income
        tax code, which costs the

> U.S. economy \$161.7 billion.

-   Comprehensive audits also impose an additional taxpayer burden of at
    least \$9.3 billion annually.

> **Summary:**

> The major points can be summarized as follows:

1.  The invention of many investment instruments has turned stock
    markets into gambling casinos that contribute to global financial
    instability.

> 12

2.  Profit is earned as a consequence of making a contribution of value
    > to the market place. It is not a goal of business.

3.  Financial manipulation in the assembly of conglomerates is often
    > counterproductive.

4.  There are three company dimensions that derive from three polar
    > insights into the creative dynamics of any company. The six
    > domains common to very company relate in polar pairs.

5.  The three dimensions correspond to how our three brains meaningfully
    > integrate phenomenal experience regardless of circumstance. A
    > business is a structural delegation of how we are structured to
    > function as human beings.

6.  It is in the long term sustainable best interests of a company to
    > equitably distribute profit between shareholder, employee and
    > customer. This new paradigm of business needs to be fostered.
    > Profit has no meaning as an end in itself.

7.  Huge executive bonuses do not attract the best managers and CEOs.

8.  Federal income tax and its cost of collection is a dead weight
    > burden on economic development. It can be replaced by simply
    > printing the money needed to run the government if the new
    > paradigm of equitable distribution of profit is enabled.

9.  About 95% of the money supply is generated by banks who are entitled
    > to loan nine times what they have on deposit. The money supply is
    > predominantly debt.

10. The national debt is the result of deficit budgets where national
    > expenditures exceed tax revenue. But printing money in lieu of tax
    > is much more efficient eliminating the deadweight burden on the
    > economy. It need not lead to inflation which is due to inequities
    > in the balance of payments.

11. Tariff protection is essential to intelligently control outsourcing
    > and the unrestricted import of cheap consumer goods that gut a
    > nation's capacity for domestic production and selfsufficiency.

12. Some nations have a natural capacity to export some products or a
    > natural need to import others. This can establish a reasonable
    > balance of payments.

13. Multinational corporations should be encouraged to establish
    > manufacturing in the nations where the products are sold.

14. Printing money to fund infrastructure and minimize unemployment by
    > maximizing the creative talents of domestic labor need have no
    > effect on inflation if the new paradigm in everyone's best
    > interest prevails.

15. Globalization as a blind belief in global free trade is a mistake.
